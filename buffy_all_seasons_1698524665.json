To Buffy's horror, Cordelia humiliates an awkward Willow at the water fountain. Inside the library, Mr. Giles places a book titled Vampyr in front of Buffy after realizing who she was.

Cordelia appeared and told Buffy she won't get to meet Coach Foster because gym class was canceled \"due to the extreme dead guy\" in Aura's locker.

However, the handsome stranger assures her that he doesn't bite and she releases him. He warns her that she is living on a Hellmouth which is about to open and that the Harvest is coming. He also gives her a silver cross necklace in a box. It won't be revealed until the next day that the stranger's name is Angel.",

The Scoobies try to figure out if there is a connection to the Master, but don't rule out that there is a second monster about. Later that night, Buffy goes into the park and confronts \"Claw,\" a vampire who has a large claw in place of a right hand. The fight is interrupted by the police, and the vampire flees.

Xander wakes up in a cage next to Blayne who tells him how she mates like a praying mantis, biting off men's heads in the process. In the library, the gang discovers that the She-Mantis lures virgins to her for her mating ritual. Willow reveals that Xander is a virgin then calls Xander's mother and finds out that he isn't home.

After class, Gregory encourages Buffy, but he is soon killed by an unseen monster.",

When Buffy and Willow arrive, Xander puts his arms around both girls in order to buff up his reputation. Buffy rushes off when Angel shows up. He gives her his jacket to warm her; and she notices several slashes on his arm. She jokes that somebody must have attacked him with a big fork. He warns her about the new threat and to not let him corner her as he'll \"rip [her] throat out.\" He leaves quickly after the warning.",

The Scoobies try to figure out if there is a connection to the Master, but don't rule out that there is a second monster about.

Xander wakes up in a cage next to Blayne who tells him how she mates like a praying mantis, biting off men's heads in the process. In the library, the gang discovers that the She-Mantis lures virgins to her for her mating ritual. Willow reveals that Xander is a virgin then calls Xander's mother and finds out that he isn't home.

                "The Master is displeased that Buffy is killing his vampires, the latest victim being Zachary. Deeming Darla's request to deal with Buffy too personally motivated, the Master decides instead to send the Three, a trio of warrior vampires, to take the Slayer out. The Three ambush Buffy on her way home from pre-fumigation night at the Bronze. Angel, whom Buffy at first suspects is the only one stalking her, shows up at a critical moment, but is wounded helping the Slayer break out of a dicey triple hold. Buffy abandons the fight and helps Angel run to her house, yelling at him to get inside. With the Three on the other side of the door, Angel explains that a vampire can't enter someone's home unless invited in. Buffy recalls hearing that, but tells Angel she's never had to put it to the test before.",
                "As Angel removes his jacket and shirt so Buffy can dress his wound, a tattoo on his back is revealed. Buffy thanks Angel for his help and asks how he happened to be so close by. Buffy's mother, Joyce, comes home from working late, so Buffy flies to the front door to be sure Joyce is safe and that no vampires get in, then tries to coax her to go up to bed immediately. Angel, now with his shirt and jacket back on, comes into the hall to meet Joyce. Buffy claims Angel is a college student tutoring her in history.",
                "Once the mildly skeptical Joyce goes upstairs, Buffy pretends to send Angel off, but instead sneaks him up to her bedroom. Angel says he doesn't want to get her into anymore trouble, but Buffy replies that she doesn't want to \"get him dead.\" They discuss the room's one bed and Angel insists on taking the floor, whereupon Buffy sends him to the window to see whether the \"fang gang\" is still lurking so his back will be turned while she changes. Buffy asks why Angel, not being the Chosen One, elects to fight vampires. She wonders what his family thinks of his career choice, so he says: \"They're dead.\" Buffy asks if it was vampires that killed his family, he replies: \"it was.\" Buffy theorizes that hunting vampires is some kind of \"vengeance gig\" for him, but Angel changes the subject. They settle down for the night in their respective spots.",
                "When the gang hears about the events the next morning, Xander protests that Angel is trying to seduce Buffy by saving her life and getting stabbed. Rupert Giles identifies the armored vampire trio and reassures everyone that the Three are no longer a threat, since they must offer their lives to the Master in penance for failing their mission. Indeed, the Master allows Darla to execute the Three, as an object lesson in the use of power for Collin, the Anointed One. Returning to the library later that day, Buffy begins weapons training. She is disappointed when Giles requires her to start with the quarterstaff rather than the \"cool\" crossbow, but easily defeats her Watcher staff-to-staff and progresses to crossbow training.",
                "Returning home, Buffy brings some supper for Angel, who has waited out the day in her room. Buffy asks Angel how he passed the time, who replies that he did \"a little reading,\" a lot of thinking. Buffy notices her diary askew and agitatedly explains away entries that reveal her crush on \"A.\" Angel stops her and explains in turn that Buffy's mother moved the diary while straightening up; Angel swears he didn't read it. He then confesses that he doesn't think he should be around her, because all he wants to do is to kiss her. As Buffy approaches him, Angel explains he's older than she is and that he should go.",
                "Buffy and Angel take a step toward each other and kiss. Suddenly, Angel pulls back with a snarl. When he turns back to her, his demon face reveals the truth \u2014 Angel is a vampire. Buffy screams and Angel escapes through the window. Joyce rushes in the bedroom and asks what happened, but Buffy says that she \"saw a shadow.\" Bringing her friends up to speed before school the next morning, Buffy wonders why Angel seems good to her. Giles insists there are no good vampires \u2014 a vampire, lacking a soul, is not even a person. Xander urges Buffy to slay Angel.",
                "Returning to his apartment, Angel becomes aware of an intruder, but seems little surprised to see Darla. She taunts him, telling him humans will never accept him for who he is, but he replies that he is no longer accepted by vampires either. Meanwhile, Giles researches Angel's history and notices the peculiarity that, even though this vampire was previously well-known as the vicious killer Angelus, he apparently has shunned the company of other vampires since coming to America and stopped preying on humans. Meanwhile, in the Master's lair, Darla insists that she be allowed to kill Buffy. The Master concedes upon hearing Darla's plan to use Angel as her weapon.",
                "Later that evening in the library, Willow is having a hard time tutoring Buffy in the history of the Civil War, since they are both distracted by gloom over boys \u2014 Buffy because she doesn't want to slay Angel and Willow because she wants to attract Xander. Lurking in the stacks, Darla eavesdrops before going to Buffy's house, where she cons Joyce into inviting her in by claiming to be yet another study buddy of Buffy's. Prowling around Buffy's house himself, Angel hears Joyce's cry and rushes in just as Darla begins to drink from her. Daring him to drink too, Darla shoves the now unconscious Joyce into Angel's arms and escapes out the back door.",
                "Buffy arrives and finds Angel in this position with her bleeding mother. She throws him out of the house then calls for an ambulance. At the hospital, Buffy, Giles, Willow, and Xander try to help Joyce reconstruct events, and she says her last memory is of inviting Buffy's \"study friend\" inside. Buffy misunderstands, thinking Joyce means Angel rather than Darla. Leaving her mother in the care of friends and doctors, Buffy races to the library, takes the crossbow from the weapons locker, and storms out into the night. At Angel's apartment, Darla tells him how easy it was to poison Buffy against him, exhorting him to kill or be killed. Meanwhile, Giles talks further with Joyce and learns enough to realize that it was Darla, not Angel, who bit her. With Xander and Willow in tow, he rushes to find Buffy to warn her of the trap.",
                "Alone in the dark, Buffy tracks Angel to the deserted Bronze and engages him in combat. Angel soon tackles and disarms Buffy, but she retrieves her weapon before he can recover his balance. The Slayer shoots wide and her bolt hits the wall beside his head. When she demands an explanation for his actions, particularly why he spared her but not her mom, Angel mockingly recounts highlights from his Angelus days. Buffy asks what changed, so Angel tells her the story of the Kalderash girl he once killed, whose family cursed him in retribution. They gave him a soul that would wrack him with guilt, eternally tormenting him for the evil he had wreaked during a century and more of unbridled vampirism. He denies biting Joyce, yet confesses wanting to, as well as wanting to kill Buffy herself. The Slayer lays aside her crossbow and offers her throat to Angel.",
                "Suddenly, Darla emerges from the shadows and starts to taunt them, boasting to Buffy that she, Darla, was the vampire who turned Angel all those decades ago.

                "The Master is displeased that Buffy is killing his vampires, the latest victim being Zachary. Deeming Darla's request to deal with Buffy too personally motivated, the Master decides instead to send the Three, a trio of warrior vampires, to take the Slayer out. The Three ambush Buffy on her way home from pre-fumigation night at the Bronze. Angel, whom Buffy at first suspects is the only one stalking her, shows up at a critical moment, but is wounded helping the Slayer break out of a dicey triple hold. Buffy abandons the fight and helps Angel run to her house, yelling at him to get inside. With the Three on the other side of the door, Angel explains that a vampire can't enter someone's home unless invited in. Buffy recalls hearing that, but tells Angel she's never had to put it to the test before.",
                "As Angel removes his jacket and shirt so Buffy can dress his wound, a tattoo on his back is revealed. Buffy thanks Angel for his help and asks how he happened to be so close by. Buffy's mother, Joyce, comes home from working late, so Buffy flies to the front door to be sure Joyce is safe and that no vampires get in, then tries to coax her to go up to bed immediately. Angel, now with his shirt and jacket back on, comes into the hall to meet Joyce. Buffy claims Angel is a college student tutoring her in history.",
                "Once the mildly skeptical Joyce goes upstairs, Buffy pretends to send Angel off, but instead sneaks him up to her bedroom. Angel says he doesn't want to get her into anymore trouble, but Buffy replies that she doesn't want to \"get him dead.\" They discuss the room's one bed and Angel insists on taking the floor, whereupon Buffy sends him to the window to see whether the \"fang gang\" is still lurking so his back will be turned while she changes. Buffy asks why Angel, not being the Chosen One, elects to fight vampires. She wonders what his family thinks of his career choice, so he says: \"They're dead.\" Buffy asks if it was vampires that killed his family, he replies: \"it was.\" Buffy theorizes that hunting vampires is some kind of \"vengeance gig\" for him, but Angel changes the subject. They settle down for the night in their respective spots.",
                "When the gang hears about the events the next morning, Xander protests that Angel is trying to seduce Buffy by saving her life and getting stabbed. Rupert Giles identifies the armored vampire trio and reassures everyone that the Three are no longer a threat, since they must offer their lives to the Master in penance for failing their mission. Indeed, the Master allows Darla to execute the Three, as an object lesson in the use of power for Collin, the Anointed One. Returning to the library later that day, Buffy begins weapons training. She is disappointed when Giles requires her to start with the quarterstaff rather than the \"cool\" crossbow, but easily defeats her Watcher staff-to-staff and progresses to crossbow training.",
                "Returning home, Buffy brings some supper for Angel, who has waited out the day in her room. Buffy asks Angel how he passed the time, who replies that he did \"a little reading,\" a lot of thinking. Buffy notices her diary askew and agitatedly explains away entries that reveal her crush on \"A.\" Angel stops her and explains in turn that Buffy's mother moved the diary while straightening up; Angel swears he didn't read it. He then confesses that he doesn't think he should be around her, because all he wants to do is to kiss her. As Buffy approaches him, Angel explains he's older than she is and that he should go.",
                "Buffy and Angel take a step toward each other and kiss. Suddenly, Angel pulls back with a snarl. When he turns back to her, his demon face reveals the truth \u2014 Angel is a vampire. Buffy screams and Angel escapes through the window. Joyce rushes in the bedroom and asks what happened, but Buffy says that she \"saw a shadow.\" Bringing her friends up to speed before school the next morning, Buffy wonders why Angel seems good to her. Giles insists there are no good vampires \u2014 a vampire, lacking a soul, is not even a person. Xander urges Buffy to slay Angel.",
                "Returning to his apartment, Angel becomes aware of an intruder, but seems little surprised to see Darla. She taunts him, telling him humans will never accept him for who he is, but he replies that he is no longer accepted by vampires either. Meanwhile, Giles researches Angel's history and notices the peculiarity that, even though this vampire was previously well-known as the vicious killer Angelus, he apparently has shunned the company of other vampires since coming to America and stopped preying on humans. Meanwhile, in the Master's lair, Darla insists that she be allowed to kill Buffy. The Master concedes upon hearing Darla's plan to use Angel as her weapon.",
                "Later that evening in the library, Willow is having a hard time tutoring Buffy in the history of the Civil War, since they are both distracted by gloom over boys \u2014 Buffy because she doesn't want to slay Angel and Willow because she wants to attract Xander. Lurking in the stacks, Darla eavesdrops before going to Buffy's house, where she cons Joyce into inviting her in by claiming to be yet another study buddy of Buffy's. Prowling around Buffy's house himself, Angel hears Joyce's cry and rushes in just as Darla begins to drink from her. Daring him to drink too, Darla shoves the now unconscious Joyce into Angel's arms and escapes out the back door.",
                "Buffy arrives and finds Angel in this position with her bleeding mother. She throws him out of the house then calls for an ambulance. At the hospital, Buffy, Giles, Willow, and Xander try to help Joyce reconstruct events, and she says her last memory is of inviting Buffy's \"study friend\" inside. Buffy misunderstands, thinking Joyce means Angel rather than Darla. Leaving her mother in the care of friends and doctors, Buffy races to the library, takes the crossbow from the weapons locker, and storms out into the night. At Angel's apartment, Darla tells him how easy it was to poison Buffy against him, exhorting him to kill or be killed. Meanwhile, Giles talks further with Joyce and learns enough to realize that it was Darla, not Angel, who bit her. With Xander and Willow in tow, he rushes to find Buffy to warn her of the trap.",
                "Alone in the dark, Buffy tracks Angel to the deserted Bronze and engages him in combat. Angel soon tackles and disarms Buffy, but she retrieves her weapon before he can recover his balance. The Slayer shoots wide and her bolt hits the wall beside his head. When she demands an explanation for his actions, particularly why he spared her but not her mom, Angel mockingly recounts highlights from his Angelus days. Buffy asks what changed, so Angel tells her the story of the Kalderash girl he once killed, whose family cursed him in retribution. They gave him a soul that would wrack him with guilt, eternally tormenting him for the evil he had wreaked during a century and more of unbridled vampirism. He denies biting Joyce, yet confesses wanting to, as well as wanting to kill Buffy herself. The Slayer lays aside her crossbow and offers her throat to Angel.",
                "Suddenly, Darla emerges from the shadows and starts to taunt them, boasting to Buffy that she, Darla, was the vampire who turned Angel all those decades ago. When Buffy levels her crossbow, Darla pulls out a pair of handguns and fires. Hit, Angel crumples to the floor. Buffy dives for cover behind the bar and looses a bolt that hits Darla's chest but misses her heart.

                "Buffy has a nightmare about going to the Master's lair and being choked by him. Her mother shakes Buffy awake, and, as Buffy wakes up, she is excited to be spending the coming weekend with her father. Buffy confides to Willow that she thinks she might have something to do with her parents' divorce. In a class, when the teacher asks Wendell to read from the text book, he opens it. However, tarantulas crawl out of it. Buffy then sees Billy standing in the doorway, saying he is sorry.",
                "The next day, as the Master explains to Collin how wonderful he finds fear, Buffy is nervous about being picked up by her father after school, and her mother calms her down. At school, Willow and Xander are worried about the spiders and want to talk to Giles about it. Giles mutters that he \"got lost,\" seemingly in the stacks of books, and we assume that something that he fears happened to him. Giles has no information on the spiders and suggests talking to Wendell. Wendell explains that he loves spiders, but says that the spiders hate Wendell because Wendell's brother killed his pet spiders when he was off at camp. He explains that the spiders crawling out is a recurring nightmare for him, but this is the first time it happened. In the meantime, Cordelia lets Buffy know about a history test that Buffy has not studied for. Buffy has a hard time even finding the class, and the test is over in what feels like little time, and Buffy has not even filled in her name. She once again sees Billy, outside the class. As break-time begins, Laura takes a smoking break in the basement, where she is assaulted by an ugly man saying: \"Lucky nineteen.\"",
                "Buffy and Giles interview Laura in the Bowers hospital, where they hear about \"lucky nineteen.\" Outside, they are shocked by the doctor saying that she got off easy until the doctor explains about Billy, who has been in a coma from assault with the same M.O. Back at school, the Scoobies are trying to come up with an explanation while a greaser kid's mother embarrasses him in front of his friends. As they are talking, Xander finds out he is in his underwear. As Buffy goes into the library to consult with Giles, he says that he has forgotten how to read. He has, however, managed to find a newspaper with a picture of Billy in an article. The article says that Billy has been in a coma for a week, which contradicts Buffy having seen him. Giles theorizes she might have been seeing Billy's astral projection.",
                "Buffy's father shows up, and asks to talk to her. Outside school, he tells Buffy that her parents' divorce is indeed her fault. Furthermore, he claims to be bored by their weekends together and decides to call the whole thing off. As Buffy is crying, he scolds her. Xander and Willow show up in the library, and they realize Wendell's, Giles's and Xander's mishaps were all based on their nightmares, which seem to be coming true for everyone. Buffy finds Billy's astral body and the ugly man who assaulted Laura finds both of them.",
                "As Buffy and Billy run away, the Scoobies decide to find Buffy and explain the situation to her. As Buffy and Billy run away from the ugly man, Billy explains to her that he was responsible for his baseball team losing and that it is a bad thing to lose at games. As Buffy and Billy find themselves in the cemetery at night-time, Willow finds herself starring in the Madame Butterfly opera. Willow is overcome by stage fright and runs away. Xander is chasing one chocolate bar after another until he finds one he has not had since his sixth birthday. However, he is soon assaulted by a knife-wielding clown. Back at the cemetery, the Master buries Buffy alive.",

As Willow, Xander and Giles find Buffy's grave, Giles claims it is his nightmare, letting Buffy die. Buffy crawls out of the grave\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a vampire. They all decide to wake up Billy from his coma to stop the nightmares. In the hospital, they find Billy's astral body near Billy's comatose body. As the ugly man finds him, Buffy confronts him. After knocking him out, she forces Billy to face him. Billy wakes up and everything is back to normal.",

Buffy confronts the coach and he tries to run, but is stopped by Giles and Xander and soon put into jail.",
                "Buffy and her father leave for their weekend together. Willow then asks Xander if he was still attracted to Buffy as a vampire. Although he initially and nervously denies it, Xander then admits: \"I'm sick. I need help.\" Willow agrees."

After class, Cordelia arranges to talk with the teacher the next day to talk about her paper.",

As Xander and Willow mock Cordelia, referring to a past Buffy did not share, she feels left out and explains that she was the May Queen at her old school. The conversation ends when they hear that Mitch was found beaten. Principal Snyder arrives confirming Mitch was not dead. Before Mitch is taken to the hospital, he tells them what had happened. Principal Snyder stops Buffy entering the crime scene but Willow and Xander distract him, allowing Buffy to slip into the boys' locker room to find the word \"LOOK\" spray-painted on the lockers.",

Meanwhile, Harmony asks Cordelia about Mitch's condition; Cordelia explains that he is alright but looking too bruised for the prom pictures. In a flashback, we see Cordelia and Harmony talking about Mitch's recent break-up with Wendy, and whether Cordelia would like to be his girlfriend. In the present, Harmony is pushed down the stairs and injures her ankle by the invisible force as Buffy approaches. Buffy follows an invisible source of laughter resulting in it bumping into Buffy before escaping.",

Another flashback sequence sees Cordelia and Harmony discussing a lecture and ignoring Marcie. In the present, Cordelia wins the May Queen award. Looking over Willow's list of missing kids, Buffy suspects Marcie when she sees she played the flute.

She is horrified to find her own greeting to Marcie, \"Have a great summer!.\" Giles realizes that Marcie became invisible not because of magic but science; she became invisible because people treated her like she didn't exist.

Angel refuses to believe what Giles is telling him but Giles insists that he's verified the prophecy which tells, without a doubt, that the next evening Buffy will face the Master and die. Buffy is understandably devastated at the idea of her impending death, and rejects Giles and Angel's attempts to comfort her and in a fit of emotion throws the books across the library. She then tells the two that she has a way around the prophecy, by quitting as the Slayer. Even though the two warn her that without her to stop him the Master will rise and unleash hell on earth, she refuses to listen and leaves the cross Angel gave her on the table. She goes back home and tries to convince her mother that they go away for the weekend. Instead, Joyce tells her that the gallery is open on weekends, and then gives her a stunning white prom dress.

Cordelia rescues them in her car, and drives the car straight into the school. Xander and Angel reach Buffy only to find that she is dead. Xander performs CPR (as Angel couldn't do it himself, since vampires don't breathe) and manages to revive her. When Buffy regains consciousness, she heads to the surface to kill the Master who is now above the library and using her power to summon all matter of beasts from the Hellmouth. Cordelia, Willow, Giles and Jenny fight off vampires trying to enter the library, and just as Giles realizes that the Hellmouth is directly underneath the library, a tentacled creature rises through the floor.

The stunned friends stare at each other wondering what to do now, and Giles suggests that they leave as he doesn't like the library that much anymore. The group decide to head to the dance, with Buffy stating \"We saved the world. I say we party.\" Miss Calendar asks about what they should do with the Master's skeleton, and Buffy tells her not to worry... he's not going anywhere, before calling him a loser.

Cordelia rescues them in her car, and drives the car straight into the school. Xander and Angel reach Buffy only to find that she is dead. Xander performs CPR (as Angel couldn't do it himself, since vampires don't breathe) and manages to revive her. When Buffy regains consciousness, she heads to the surface to kill the Master who is now above the library and using her power to summon all matter of beasts from the Hellmouth. Cordelia, Willow, Giles and Jenny fight off vampires trying to enter the library, and just as Giles realizes that the Hellmouth is directly underneath the library, a tentacled creature rises through the floor. Buffy throws the Master into the library, where he is impaled on a jutting piece of wood and his soft tissues disintegrate, leaving only his skeleton and the Hellmouth closes, sucking the tentacled creature back down.",
                "The gang regroup and reflect on everything that happened, including Buffy's temporary death. The Hellmouth is closed and the vampires have gone, the world is saved. Giles notes that he should have known Buffy wouldn't have let death stop her. The stunned friends stare at each other wondering what to do now, and Giles suggests that they leave as he doesn't like the library that much anymore. The group decide to head to the dance, with Buffy stating \"We saved the world. I say we party.\" Miss Calendar asks about what they should do with the Master's skeleton, and Buffy tells her not to worry... he's not going anywhere, before calling him a loser. The gang then leave for the Bronze, leaving the skeleton behind."

                "On Thursday night, the Scoobies are making weapons in the library while Buffy is preparing the buffet. Despite Buffy's best efforts to keep her mother, Joyce, from meeting any teachers or Principal Snyder, Joyce eventually meets the principal, and then she sternly orders Buffy home just as Spike and the other vampires crash through the window, too impatient to wait for Saturday. In the ensuing fight, Buffy leads the adults to safety in the science room while Xander, Giles, and Ms. Calendar barricade themselves in the library. Willow and Cordelia hide in a utility closet. Xander is sent out to get Angel. Buffy takes command of the incredulous adults, telling them to stay put as she climbs through the air ducts to reach the library and her weapons.",
                "Xander returns to the school with Angel, who pretends to be his former evil self. Though Spike first welcomes Angel as a long-lost friend, he sees through the ruse and Xander and Angel are forced to flee. Xander hears Spike say that Angel was his sire. Buffy and Spike finally meet in the hall, and Buffy is almost bested when her mother shows up and hits Spike over the head with the flat of a fire axe. With the curse \"Women!\", he retreats. Joyce tells Buffy that she doesn't care about what Snyder said and is proud to have a daughter who knows how to take care of herself and others in a crisis. Snyder tells the police chief to say that the trouble was caused by a gang on PCP. When the chief wonders if people will believe it, Snyder asks if he'd rather tell the truth. Meanwhile, not knowing the vampires are long gone, Willow and Cordelia are still hiding out in the utility closet where Cordelia prays to God to be rescued, while Willow is desperate to be rescued from her company.",
                "Spike returns to the factory and meets with Drusilla, telling her that he's never encountered a Slayer with friends or family but still promises to kill her soon. He then approaches the Anointed One who demands penance for attacking too early. After starting to go through the motions, Spike decides that he won't reduce himself to groveling for forgiveness from a kid and instead throws the boy in a cage and pulls it into the sun, killing him. From now on, he says, there will be less ritual and more fun in Sunnydale."

He says that her mother shouldn't be forced to be alone, and she should give Ted the benefit of the doubt. She reluctantly complies with this idea.

As Drusilla follows her, Buffy carries her glass down the hall to find that her bathroom is the Bronze. Buffy moves through the crowd of people dancing slowly and sees Willow speaking French to an organ-grinder's monkey. She then encounters her mother, who asks \"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?\" before the saucer she holds drops to the floor and breaks. As Joyce turns away, Buffy moves back into the crowd, then turns herself, smiling at something she sees behind her. The crowd has parted and Angel is slowly coming toward her, smiling as well. Suddenly, Drusilla steps up behind Angel and stakes him in the back. Angel, in agony, reaches toward Buffy's reaching hand, but his fingers turn to dust before they can touch. In vamp-face, Drusilla says: \"Happy birthday, Buffy.\" Buffy wakes up with a gasp.",
                "Angel answers a knock at the door of his apartment to find Buffy, who wants to see with her own eyes that he's all right. Hearing that she dreamed that Drusilla was still alive and killed him, Angel tries to comfort Buffy reasoning with her, but, when her anxiety only seems to escalate, he kisses her. Buffy deepens their embrace until she reluctantly pulls away, saying she needs to get to school. Angel agrees she must, then catches her and kisses her again. Feigning resolve, Buffy moves toward the door while Angel stalks her, corners her, and kisses her yet again. He then reminds Buffy to tell him what she'd like for a gift. She says: \"Surprise me.\" Angel smiles and murmurs \"Okay, I will,\" then kisses her one last time. Buffy confesses that it's becoming harder to say goodbye, no matter whose bedtime it is. Angel agrees.",
                "Walking across school grounds, Buffy tells Willow all. The two friends wonder whether Buffy is ready to take her relationship with Angel to the next level and Willow is awed to hear that Buffy believes it's \"sort of inevitable.\" They spot Oz. Buffy encourages Willow to go talk to him, then continues on her way. Delighted when Oz asks her out, Willow remembers with chagrin that the Scoobies are throwing Buffy a surprise birthday party the following night. Oz is delighted in turn when Willow invites him to go as her date. Inside, at their lockers, Xander tries to suggest that Cordelia be his date to the party, since they'll both be going anyway, but she still doesn't want anyone to know about their relationship. Xander stalks away and runs into Giles, then Buffy and Ms. Calendar. The four of them take a table in the lounge area, but Xander doesn't stay long. Buffy fills Giles in about her nightmare and her fears for Angel. Giles concedes that Buffy's dream could be a portent, but insists they can protect Angel in any case. Buffy, still worried, goes off to class.",

Drusilla dismisses his request to leave Sunnydale and continues to decorate their lair for the upcoming event. Dru then begins to fuss over the roses, so Spike indulges her with a peek into one of her presents. She opens and tells Spike \"this will be the best party ever\" because \"it will be the last,\" then slams the box shut.",
                "The next morning, her birthday, Buffy tells her mom she suddenly feels \"responsible, mature, and level-headed\" enough to become a licensed driver, to which Joyce replies: \"Uncanny.\" Buffy continues to plead, but is stunned to hear her mother ask \"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?\" and to watch a plate slip from Joyce's fingers and shatter on the kitchen floor. Before class, Jenny arranges her desk and is surprised by a visitor, her uncle Enyos, who came to remind her that she is Janna, of the Kalderash people, and must still fulfill her obligations to her tribe. She has been sent to Sunnydale to make sure Angel's curse remains intact, but the elder woman can sense that Angel's pain is lessening. Jenny tells him that \"there's a girl\" in Angel's life, so her uncle lectures her about the purpose of Angel's curse as vengeance for killing their tribe's favorite daughter, then charges Jenny with the task of separating Angel from the girl.",
                "Meanwhile, in the library, Buffy tells Giles, Willow, and Xander that her dream is coming true, so Drusilla might be a threat to Angel. Giles agrees and says he'll read up on the vampire to see if she has any particular patterns. Buffy agrees to return at 7:00 that evening and wanders away. Willow and Xander conclude that the current crisis puts the kibosh on their party plans, but Giles insists they celebrate regardless. At night, Jenny intercepts Buffy, saying that Giles has changed the plan and wants to meet her somewhere else. Buffy accepts her ride. Recognizing that they are near the Bronze, Buffy suddenly spots vampire activity around a truck backed up to a well-lit loading dock. Despite Jenny's demurral, Buffy goes to slay them while she waits in the car. Buffy recognizes Dalton from Spike's crew. She stakes one of the other vamps but, while she engages with a second, Dalton runs away empty-handed.",
                "While Angel and the Scoobies hide waiting for Buffy to arrive, she and the last vamp crash through a window into the Bronze. With the fight inside, Oz \u2014 getting his first exposure of Buffy staking a vampire \u2014 concludes that it \"explains a lot.\" Jenny then brings in the crate left behind by Spike's vamps. They open it and find an armored, gauntlet, severed arm, which comes alive and tries to strangle Buffy. After prying her loose, Angel explains his suspicion that Dru is attempting to bring back a powerful demon called the Judge, whose purpose is to rid the world of \"the plague of humanity\" by \"burning the righteous down,\" leaving only the evil alive.",
                "Recognizing Angel's account, Giles further explains that the Judge could not be killed, even by an entire army, and was only neutralized by being dismembered and its pieces scattered to \"every corner of the earth.\" Angel warns that, if Spike and Dru succeed, reassembling the Judge will \"bring forth Armageddon.\" Giles says they must get the arm as far away as possible, and Jenny states that Angel has to be the one to take it. Angel accepts the mission to take the Judge's arm to \"the remotest region possible,\" a trip that could take months, and knows he must leave immediately. Jenny offers to drive Angel to the docks.",
                "Back at their lair, Dru threatens to poke out Dalton's eyes for losing her present, but Spike convinces her to give the scholar one more chance to find it again.",
                "Leaving Jenny to wait in the car, Buffy walks Angel up to the pier. Both crying, he gives her the Claddagh ring he chose for her gift. Buffy pleads with Angel to stay, but he hushes her, urging her not to dwell on the time they'll be apart or the dangers they'll each certainly face. After they kiss, Angel is interrupted by a vampire attack. In the ensuing fight, Buffy is thrown off the pier and Angel leaps into the water after her, leaving Dalton and two vamp thugs to make away with the box containing the Judge's arm.",
                "The gang (minus Oz and Cordelia) congregates back at the library to research a way to find Dru and stop the Judge. Knowing she hasn't been sleeping well lately, the others let Buffy rest in Giles' office, where she slips into a dream of a dim interior containing candles, greenery, and Ms. Calendar. Wearing a long white satin nightgown, the dreaming Slayer bends to examine a collection of boxes that seem to contain other pieces of the Judge. At that moment, Drusilla calls to her from the catwalk above, where she holds Angel hostage. When Dru presses a dagger to his throat, Buffy yells and wakes up, with Angel sitting right beside her.",
                "Back at the lair, Dru's party gets underway and Spike presents her with the final piece to the puzzle: the Judge's head. With the last box in place, the whole structure glows and opens down the middle, revealing the blue-skinned horned demon inside. The Judge totters a bit when he steps from his reassembled coffin, so Spike confronts the demon about his murky intentions and weakened condition. Eager to see some action, Dru offers the Judge a \"party favor.\" The demon chooses Dalton, who retains some vestige of humanity, and burns the vampire to ash. Dru and Spike are excited by the show.",
                "Buffy, recognizing the factory from her dream, takes Angel on a recon mission, sending the others to various transport locales, just in case the final pieces of the Judge have yet to arrive. At the factory, Buffy and Angel sneak along the catwalk and see Spike and Drusilla entertaining their guests below. Just as they realize what they are seeing, the Judge becomes aware of their presence. Buffy and Angel are captured and brought before the Judge, Spike, and Dru, but manage to break free before the demon can kill them. Together, they escape through the sewers and emerge above ground in the pouring rain. They hold hands and run for shelter.",
                "Angel sheds his dripping coat as soon as they reach his apartment. To alleviate her shaking, he brings Buffy some dry clothes and urges her to get under the covers to get warm. Angel turns his back as she changes, but starts at her audible wince. Sitting on the bed to inspect a cut on her back, Angel slips the camisole strap from her shoulder and tells her it's already healing. Buffy leans back into his embrace. She begins to weep and says: \"You almost went away today.\" Angel replies: \"We both did.\" He gets to tell her what he wanted to say on the docks: \"I love you, Buffy. I try not to, but I can't stop.\" She tells him she feels the same way, then kisses him.

                "Buffy tosses in her sleep, then wakes up thirsty, but the water glass by her bed is empty. As Drusilla follows her, Buffy carries her glass down the hall to find that her bathroom is the Bronze. Buffy moves through the crowd of people dancing slowly and sees Willow speaking French to an organ-grinder's monkey. She then encounters her mother, who asks \"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?\" before the saucer she holds drops to the floor and breaks. As Joyce turns away, Buffy moves back into the crowd, then turns herself, smiling at something she sees behind her. The crowd has parted and Angel is slowly coming toward her, smiling as well. Suddenly, Drusilla steps up behind Angel and stakes him in the back. Angel, in agony, reaches toward Buffy's reaching hand, but his fingers turn to dust before they can touch. In vamp-face, Drusilla says: \"Happy birthday, Buffy.\" Buffy wakes up with a gasp.",
                "Angel answers a knock at the door of his apartment to find Buffy, who wants to see with her own eyes that he's all right. Hearing that she dreamed that Drusilla was still alive and killed him, Angel tries to comfort Buffy reasoning with her, but, when her anxiety only seems to escalate, he kisses her. Buffy deepens their embrace until she reluctantly pulls away, saying she needs to get to school. Angel agrees she must, then catches her and kisses her again. Feigning resolve, Buffy moves toward the door while Angel stalks her, corners her, and kisses her yet again. He then reminds Buffy to tell him what she'd like for a gift. She says: \"Surprise me.\" Angel smiles and murmurs \"Okay, I will,\" then kisses her one last time. Buffy confesses that it's becoming harder to say goodbye, no matter whose bedtime it is. Angel agrees.",
                "Walking across school grounds, Buffy tells Willow all. The two friends wonder whether Buffy is ready to take her relationship with Angel to the next level and Willow is awed to hear that Buffy believes it's \"sort of inevitable.\" They spot Oz. Buffy encourages Willow to go talk to him, then continues on her way. Delighted when Oz asks her out, Willow remembers with chagrin that the Scoobies are throwing Buffy a surprise birthday party the following night. Oz is delighted in turn when Willow invites him to go as her date. Inside, at their lockers, Xander tries to suggest that Cordelia be his date to the party, since they'll both be going anyway, but she still doesn't want anyone to know about their relationship. Xander stalks away and runs into Giles, then Buffy and Ms. Calendar. The four of them take a table in the lounge area, but Xander doesn't stay long. Buffy fills Giles in about her nightmare and her fears for Angel. Giles concedes that Buffy's dream could be a portent, but insists they can protect Angel in any case. Buffy, still worried, goes off to class.",
                "Meanwhile, Spike, in a wheelchair and with burn scars on his face, tries to talk Dru into having her party in Vienna to escape further interference from Angel and the Slayer. Drusilla dismisses his request to leave Sunnydale and continues to decorate their lair for the upcoming event. Dru then begins to fuss over the roses, so Spike indulges her with a peek into one of her presents. She opens and tells Spike \"this will be the best party ever\" because \"it will be the last,\" then slams the box shut.",
                "The next morning, her birthday, Buffy tells her mom she suddenly feels \"responsible, mature, and level-headed\" enough to become a licensed driver, to which Joyce replies: \"Uncanny.\" Buffy continues to plead, but is stunned to hear her mother ask \"Do you really think you're ready, Buffy?\" and to watch a plate slip from Joyce's fingers and shatter on the kitchen floor. Before class, Jenny arranges her desk and is surprised by a visitor, her uncle Enyos, who came to remind her that she is Janna, of the Kalderash people, and must still fulfill her obligations to her tribe. She has been sent to Sunnydale to make sure Angel's curse remains intact, but the elder woman can sense that Angel's pain is lessening. Jenny tells him that \"there's a girl\" in Angel's life, so her uncle lectures her about the purpose of Angel's curse as vengeance for killing their tribe's favorite daughter, then charges Jenny with the task of separating Angel from the girl.",
                "Meanwhile, in the library, Buffy tells Giles, Willow, and Xander that her dream is coming true, so Drusilla might be a threat to Angel. Giles agrees and says he'll read up on the vampire to see if she has any particular patterns. Buffy agrees to return at 7:00 that evening and wanders away. Willow and Xander conclude that the current crisis puts the kibosh on their party plans, but Giles insists they celebrate regardless. At night, Jenny intercepts Buffy, saying that Giles has changed the plan and wants to meet her somewhere else. Buffy accepts her ride. Recognizing that they are near the Bronze, Buffy suddenly spots vampire activity around a truck backed up to a well-lit loading dock. Despite Jenny's demurral, Buffy goes to slay them while she waits in the car. Buffy recognizes Dalton from Spike's crew. She stakes one of the other vamps but, while she engages with a second, Dalton runs away empty-handed.",
                "While Angel and the Scoobies hide waiting for Buffy to arrive, she and the last vamp crash through a window into the Bronze. With the fight inside, Oz \u2014 getting his first exposure of Buffy staking a vampire \u2014 concludes that it \"explains a lot.\" Jenny then brings in the crate left behind by Spike's vamps. They open it and find an armored, gauntlet, severed arm, which comes alive and tries to strangle Buffy. After prying her loose, Angel explains his suspicion that Dru is attempting to bring back a powerful demon called the Judge, whose purpose is to rid the world of \"the plague of humanity\" by \"burning the righteous down,\" leaving only the evil alive.",
                "Recognizing Angel's account, Giles further explains that the Judge could not be killed, even by an entire army, and was only neutralized by being dismembered and its pieces scattered to \"every corner of the earth.\" Angel warns that, if Spike and Dru succeed, reassembling the Judge will \"bring forth Armageddon.\" Giles says they must get the arm as far away as possible, and Jenny states that Angel has to be the one to take it. Angel accepts the mission to take the Judge's arm to \"the remotest region possible,\" a trip that could take months, and knows he must leave immediately. Jenny offers to drive Angel to the docks.",
                "Back at their lair, Dru threatens to poke out Dalton's eyes for losing her present, but Spike convinces her to give the scholar one more chance to find it again.",
                "Leaving Jenny to wait in the car, Buffy walks Angel up to the pier. Both crying, he gives her the Claddagh ring he chose for her gift. Buffy pleads with Angel to stay, but he hushes her, urging her not to dwell on the time they'll be apart or the dangers they'll each certainly face. After they kiss, Angel is interrupted by a vampire attack. In the ensuing fight, Buffy is thrown off the pier and Angel leaps into the water after her, leaving Dalton and two vamp thugs to make away with the box containing the Judge's arm.",
                "The gang (minus Oz and Cordelia) congregates back at the library to research a way to find Dru and stop the Judge. Knowing she hasn't been sleeping well lately, the others let Buffy rest in Giles' office, where she slips into a dream of a dim interior containing candles, greenery, and Ms. Calendar. Wearing a long white satin nightgown, the dreaming Slayer bends to examine a collection of boxes that seem to contain other pieces of the Judge. At that moment, Drusilla calls to her from the catwalk above, where she holds Angel hostage. When Dru presses a dagger to his throat, Buffy yells and wakes up, with Angel sitting right beside her.",
                "Back at the lair, Dru's party gets underway and Spike presents her with the final piece to the puzzle: the Judge's head. With the last box in place, the whole structure glows and opens down the middle, revealing the blue-skinned horned demon inside. The Judge totters a bit when he steps from his reassembled coffin, so Spike confronts the demon about his murky intentions and weakened condition. Eager to see some action, Dru offers the Judge a \"party favor.\" The demon chooses Dalton, who retains some vestige of humanity, and burns the vampire to ash. Dru and Spike are excited by the show.",
                "Buffy, recognizing the factory from her dream, takes Angel on a recon mission, sending the others to various transport locales, just in case the final pieces of the Judge have yet to arrive. At the factory, Buffy and Angel sneak along the catwalk and see Spike and Drusilla entertaining their guests below. Just as they realize what they are seeing, the Judge becomes aware of their presence. Buffy and Angel are captured and brought before the Judge, Spike, and Dru, but manage to break free before the demon can kill them. Together, they escape through the sewers and emerge above ground in the pouring rain. They hold hands and run for shelter.",
                "Angel sheds his dripping coat as soon as they reach his apartment. To alleviate her shaking, he brings Buffy some dry clothes and urges her to get under the covers to get warm. Angel turns his back as she changes, but starts at her audible wince. Sitting on the bed to inspect a cut on her back, Angel slips the camisole strap from her shoulder and tells her it's already healing. Buffy leans back into his embrace. She begins to weep and says: \"You almost went away today.\" Angel replies: \"We both did.\" He gets to tell her what he wanted to say on the docks: \"I love you, Buffy. I try not to, but I can't stop.\" She tells him she feels the same way, then kisses him. Angel pulls back to murmur that \"Buffy, maybe we shouldn't,\" but Buffy puts her finger to his lips and tells him: \"Don't. Just kiss me.\" He sinks backward beneath her.",

Joyce asks Buffy what she did for her birthday, and Buffy simply answers that she got older. Joyce lights the candle on the cupcake and reminds Buffy to make a wish, however Buffy chooses not to and instead leaves it to burn before cuddling up in the arms of her mother."

He wishes that dating was like slaying \u2014 \"direct, to the heart, no muss, no fuss.\" Just then, a vampire rises from the ground, which Buffy disposes of quickly, before telling him that slaying is a little bit more dangerous than dating, which prompts Xander to remind her that she is not dating Cordelia.",

Meanwhile, in class, he witnesses Amy, whom he knows is the daughter of a witch, bewitching Ms. Beakman into thinking she has handed in her homework. After the class ends, Xander tells Willow and Buffy what he saw. Considering witchcraft didn't turn out well for Amy's mom, Xander decides that he should talk to Amy and warn her about practicing witchcraft. Giles soon arrives to talk to Buffy, but the conversation turns awkward when Jenny runs into them. Jenny tells Giles that she needs to speak to him personally.

At the Bronze, Oz and his band, Dingoes Ate My Baby, are playing, and Willow happily watches her boyfriend play. Cordelia arrives, but her \"friends\" again rebuff her. Xander approaches a sad Cordelia, presenting her with her Valentine's gift, a heart necklace, and telling her that it may be just teenage hormones that's driving their relationship, or it may be more than that. Cordelia is at first impressed and joyful with the gift, but quickly tells Xander that she wants to break up, because \"we don't fit.\" Xander, agitated, walks off, leaving Cordelia looking sorry and unhappy.",

He tries to talk to Buffy, but she is preoccupied with Angel's visit and brushes him off. Xander then confronts Amy about his knowledge of her magic and then proceeds to blackmail her into casting a love spell for him. Amy reminds him that love spells have to be pure, and Xander tells her that the love spell is \"pure\" hateful vengeance. To complete the love spell, Xander needs something that belongs to Cordelia, so he quickly asks her for the necklace back.

Apparently, the spell has worked on all the women in Sunnydale except for Cordelia. Xander goes to the library and recounts everything to Giles, asking for help. Giles seems disbelieving at first, until Jenny arrives to apologize for her deceit in regards to Angel but gets distracted by Xander's muscles. Giles stresses how irresponsible and serious Xander's stunt was, telling him that women under the thrall of a love spell can be deadly.

Suddenly, Amy turns up and, claiming Xander loves her, she and Buffy get into a fight. Xander can only watch helplessly. Then, Amy performs a spell and turns Buffy into a rat. Giles and Jenny return, and while Jenny and Amy glare at each other \u2014 with Amy almost turning Jenny into a rat as well \u2014 the two men try to capture the Buffy-rat. The situation gets even worse when Oz shows up and punches Xander in the face for rejecting Willow the night before, as she was on the phone with him all night, crying. The distraction leads the Buffy-rat to escape into the basement. Giles angrily tells Xander to go home before he does any more damage, and asks Oz to help him look for Buffy-rat.",

Xander rescues her and they leave the school together. As they walk outside, they are confronted by an army of Sunnydale ladies, led by an axe-wielding, grief-stricken Willow. As she starts toward him with the axe, Harmony and her friends soon catch up with them. The two groups fight: one looking to hurt Xander, and the other looking to protect him. The girls are distracted enough for Cordelia and Xander to escape to Buffy's house, much to Joyce's delight, as she is also in love with Xander. She sends Cordelia away to get bandages for Xander's wounds, and uses the alone time to flirt with him. Back in the library, Giles enlists Amy and Jenny's help to reverse the spell, but neither of them want to do anything other than chase after Xander. Jenny manages to flee to find Xander.

Just before he's able to, however, Angel is blindsided. Xander initially thinks Buffy has arrived, but his savior is actually Drusilla, who has also fallen under the love spell. Angel is confused as to why she saved him, but Drusilla tells her sire that she's finally found a real man, and announces her plan to turn Xander into a vampire. Before she sires Xander, the two are besieged by the mob of women and separated. Willow is about to cut Xander's head off, but is stopped by Cordelia. She and Xander are able to flee into the house and attempt to block the front door. Drusilla knocks the back door off its hinges, allowing more women to enter, but Drusilla is unable to enter herself, as she has never been invited inside. Xander and Cordelia have to run again when Joyce arrives with a knife to kill Xander to stop anyone else from having him, and they take refuge in the basement.

Willow throws a coat over his head, and he is turned away by the three's crosses. Buffy faints and the gang rush her to the hospital. After being stabilized, she is admitted to the hospital for a few days against her will. Her mother reveals that Buffy has always hated hospitals, ever since her cousin Celia died in one while Buffy was in the room.",
                "Joyce brings up the topic of Ms. Calendar's death to Giles, which he would much rather forget. Meanwhile, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia wait to protect a very sick Buffy from Angel. That night, as the clocks changes to 2:27, Buffy sees a small boy standing in her doorway. He leaves, then a strange-looking man, not quite human, follows after him, glancing into Buffy's room as he goes. As she follows the man down the hall, she thinks back at her cousin and them playing when they were younger. She also remembers Cecilia's time spent in the hospital. Buffy awakes and the clock changes to 2:27. She takes a walk down the hall. Two men exit the children's ward with a child who had died that night. At the door, she overhears Dr. Wilkinson reprimending Dr. Backerfor his experimental treatments on the children and raising their temperature to dangerous levels. As Buffy begins to leave, she encounters two children that tell her about \"Death\": he comes at night, and the grown-ups can't see him.",
                "That night, Angel comes to the hospital with flowers, but Xander stands guard. They stand face to face and exchange threats. Angel taunts Xander about how he's still in love with Buffy and how jealous he must be that Angel got her first. Angel says that Xander standing in his way wouldn't stop him from going into Buffy's room, and Xander points out the guards, policemen, doctors, and orderlies. Angel leaves.",
                "The next morning, Dr. Wilkinson comes to check on Buffy. She comments on the fact that Buffy's wrist is no longer swollen and how fast she seemed to heal. Buffy, still anxious about being in the hospital, says that's great and that she can leave. Dr Wilkinson pushes her back into the bed just as Buffy's friends visit and tells them to try to keep Buffy from bolting. They come bearing gifts to cheer her up \u2014 Xander with balloons, Willow with Buffy's finished homework, and grapes from Giles. Cordelia claims she was \"out of the loop on gifts\" and Giles points out that gifts for people in the hospital are common among humans. They all take a walk outside and Buffy tells them about the conversation she overheard: Dr. Backer was trying experimental treatments on the kids and Dr. Wilkinson doesn't agree with him.",
                "Buffy says she thought she saw something too. However Cordelia asks if maybe Buffy is just creating a demon because she needs something to fight so she doesn't feel so powerless in the hospital. Buffy does say that she's not sure but, since she is forced to stay at the hospital, she plans to find out what the doctor is up to. Xander volunteers everyone's help. Cordelia and Xander sneak into the hospital's record room and search for records on the girl that died that night, Tina. Meanwhile, Giles and Willow search for information at the school library. Cordelia is caught by the security guard. She flirts with him until Xander can escape with the records. When she leaves the guard, Xander expresses his jealousy and Cordelia expresses her anger about Xander's behavior around Buffy. She leaves to take the records to Giles, and Xander \"watches her back\" as she goes.",
                "Buffy takes a walk in the hospital and finds the little boy, Ryan. He is drawing a picture of the man she saw in her dream. Willow digs up information on Dr. Backer at the library with Giles, and she finds that he has a large past of experimental treatments and investigations into his practices. Meanwhile, Dr. Backer is working on trying to cure the children's illnesses. After finding a solution that he thinks will work, he takes it to the children's ward to try it out. Before he can do anything, an invisible creature attacks him, slashing him up. Buffy tries to stop him but is thrown aside.",

Joyce walks in with the good news that Buffy can go home, but Buffy insists she should stay a little longer. Confused, her mother leaves to tell the doctor. Xander, Giles, and Cordelia leave her alone and come up with a plan. Giles and Cordelia head back to the library while Xander stands guard in case Angel shows up. At the library, after thoroughly annoying Giles, Cordelia closes the book she was looking through, only to find a picture of the monster on the cover.",
                "Later, Cordelia calls Buffy to tell her that the monster is called der Kindestod and the name means \"child death.\" When Giles comes in with a book on how he kills, Cordelia only express disgust. Giles takes over and tell Buffy that he sits atop his prey, pinning the child down while he slowly sucks their life out. Buffy thinks back to her time at the hospital as a child again, seeing her cousin Celia screaming and fighting at something on top of her. Buffy goes silent over the phone and after a few moments, Willow takes it from her, thanks Giles, and hangs up. Buffy then realizes that der Kindestod was also the killer of her cousin.",
                "Buffy questions how she's going to fight the monster when she can't see him. Willow points out that she did see him once and Buffy realizes that it was her high fever that gave her the ability. The two head to Dr. Backer's office in search of answers. They find out that Dr. Backer was giving the children injections of the disease they already have in order to inoculate them. Buffy decides to induct herself with one of the vials the doctor was using on the children. Willow stops her, warning her that the liquid is 100% pure and would kill Buffy instantly if she drinks one. Willow then dilutes two drops of the medicine in water so Buffy can drink it safely.",
                "Buffy's fever rushes up to a near 107 degrees as she stumbles to the children's ward. She finds all the children are gone. They have headed down to the basement in hopes of escaping from death. Buffy's fever kicks in and she sees der Kindestod in the children's room and watches as he heads down to the basement. The room's door is locked so Buffy and Willow rush to find access to the basement. Dr. Wilkinson tries to stop them, but Buffy shoves her aside. When security guards stop the two, Willow start screaming that frogs are all over her, so Buffy makes her escape. Dr. Wilkinson tells them they needed to stop the other girl, not Willow.",
                "Buffy works her way to Xander, and he helps her down to the basement. The children wait quietly in hopes of not being found, but then der Kindestod picks up Ryan. He and all the other children scream, and der Kindestod tosses him to the floor. H climbs atop Ryan, two tubes coming out of his eyes to settle over Ryan. Buffy arrives just in time, smacking the demon over his head with a board, then fights him off. Just as his tubes come out of his eyes to cover hers, she kills der Kindestod snapping his neck. Xander arrives and Buffy leaves leaning on him.",
                "Buffy finishes her rehabilitation at home, with Xander and Willow laying with her on bed watching TV. Joyce waits on all their requests to bring more snacks to them. Joyce then hands Buffy a letter from Ryan: a drawing of her hailing over der Kindestod, complete with copious amounts of blood coming from the demon's neck. Joyce states the drawing is \"... nice.\""

Willow throws a coat over his head, and he is turned away by the three's crosses. Buffy faints and the gang rush her to the hospital. After being stabilized, she is admitted to the hospital for a few days against her will. Her mother reveals that Buffy has always hated hospitals, ever since her cousin Celia died in one while Buffy was in the room.",
                "Joyce brings up the topic of Ms. Calendar's death to Giles, which he would much rather forget. Meanwhile, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia wait to protect a very sick Buffy from Angel. That night, as the clocks changes to 2:27, Buffy sees a small boy standing in her doorway. He leaves, then a strange-looking man, not quite human, follows after him, glancing into Buffy's room as he goes. As she follows the man down the hall, she thinks back at her cousin and them playing when they were younger. She also remembers Cecilia's time spent in the hospital. Buffy awakes and the clock changes to 2:27. She takes a walk down the hall. Two men exit the children's ward with a child who had died that night. At the door, she overhears Dr. Wilkinson reprimending Dr. Backerfor his experimental treatments on the children and raising their temperature to dangerous levels. As Buffy begins to leave, she encounters two children that tell her about \"Death\": he comes at night, and the grown-ups can't see him.",
                "That night, Angel comes to the hospital with flowers, but Xander stands guard. They stand face to face and exchange threats. Angel taunts Xander about how he's still in love with Buffy and how jealous he must be that Angel got her first. Angel says that Xander standing in his way wouldn't stop him from going into Buffy's room, and Xander points out the guards, policemen, doctors, and orderlies. Angel leaves.",
                "The next morning, Dr. Wilkinson comes to check on Buffy. She comments on the fact that Buffy's wrist is no longer swollen and how fast she seemed to heal. Buffy, still anxious about being in the hospital, says that's great and that she can leave. Dr Wilkinson pushes her back into the bed just as Buffy's friends visit and tells them to try to keep Buffy from bolting. They come bearing gifts to cheer her up \u2014 Xander with balloons, Willow with Buffy's finished homework, and grapes from Giles. Cordelia claims she was \"out of the loop on gifts\" and Giles points out that gifts for people in the hospital are common among humans. They all take a walk outside and Buffy tells them about the conversation she overheard: Dr. Backer was trying experimental treatments on the kids and Dr. Wilkinson doesn't agree with him.",
                "Buffy says she thought she saw something too. However Cordelia asks if maybe Buffy is just creating a demon because she needs something to fight so she doesn't feel so powerless in the hospital. Buffy does say that she's not sure but, since she is forced to stay at the hospital, she plans to find out what the doctor is up to. Xander volunteers everyone's help. Cordelia and Xander sneak into the hospital's record room and search for records on the girl that died that night, Tina. Meanwhile, Giles and Willow search for information at the school library. Cordelia is caught by the security guard. She flirts with him until Xander can escape with the records. When she leaves the guard, Xander expresses his jealousy and Cordelia expresses her anger about Xander's behavior around Buffy. She leaves to take the records to Giles, and Xander \"watches her back\" as she goes.",
                "Buffy takes a walk in the hospital and finds the little boy, Ryan. He is drawing a picture of the man she saw in her dream. Willow digs up information on Dr. Backer at the library with Giles, and she finds that he has a large past of experimental treatments and investigations into his practices. Meanwhile, Dr. Backer is working on trying to cure the children's illnesses. After finding a solution that he thinks will work, he takes it to the children's ward to try it out. Before he can do anything, an invisible creature attacks him, slashing him up. Buffy tries to stop him but is thrown aside.",
                "The next morning, Buffy informs everyone that Dr. Backer is not the suspect, and shows them the drawing that Ryan made of the creature. Joyce walks in with the good news that Buffy can go home, but Buffy insists she should stay a little longer. Confused, her mother leaves to tell the doctor. Xander, Giles, and Cordelia leave her alone and come up with a plan. Giles and Cordelia head back to the library while Xander stands guard in case Angel shows up. At the library, after thoroughly annoying Giles, Cordelia closes the book she was looking through, only to find a picture of the monster on the cover.",
                "Later, Cordelia calls Buffy to tell her that the monster is called der Kindestod and the name means \"child death.\" When Giles comes in with a book on how he kills, Cordelia only express disgust. Giles takes over and tell Buffy that he sits atop his prey, pinning the child down while he slowly sucks their life out. Buffy thinks back to her time at the hospital as a child again, seeing her cousin Celia screaming and fighting at something on top of her. Buffy goes silent over the phone and after a few moments, Willow takes it from her, thanks Giles, and hangs up. Buffy then realizes that der Kindestod was also the killer of her cousin.",
                "Buffy questions how she's going to fight the monster when she can't see him. Willow points out that she did see him once and Buffy realizes that it was her high fever that gave her the ability. The two head to Dr. Backer's office in search of answers. They find out that Dr. Backer was giving the children injections of the disease they already have in order to inoculate them. Buffy decides to induct herself with one of the vials the doctor was using on the children. Willow stops her, warning her that the liquid is 100% pure and would kill Buffy instantly if she drinks one. Willow then dilutes two drops of the medicine in water so Buffy can drink it safely.",
                "Buffy's fever rushes up to a near 107 degrees as she stumbles to the children's ward. She finds all the children are gone. They have headed down to the basement in hopes of escaping from death. Buffy's fever kicks in and she sees der Kindestod in the children's room and watches as he heads down to the basement. The room's door is locked so Buffy and Willow rush to find access to the basement. Dr. Wilkinson tries to stop them, but Buffy shoves her aside. When security guards stop the two, Willow start screaming that frogs are all over her, so Buffy makes her escape. Dr. Wilkinson tells them they needed to stop the other girl, not Willow.",
                "Buffy works her way to Xander, and he helps her down to the basement. The children wait quietly in hopes of not being found, but then der Kindestod picks up Ryan. He and all the other children scream, and der Kindestod tosses him to the floor. H climbs atop Ryan, two tubes coming out of his eyes to settle over Ryan. Buffy arrives just in time, smacking the demon over his head with a board, then fights him off. Just as his tubes come out of his eyes to cover hers, she kills der Kindestod snapping his neck. Xander arrives and Buffy leaves leaning on him.",
                "Buffy finishes her rehabilitation at home, with Xander and Willow laying with her on bed watching TV. Joyce waits on all their requests to bring more snacks to them. Joyce then hands Buffy a letter from Ryan: a drawing of her hailing over der Kindestod, complete with copious amounts of blood coming from the demon's neck. Joyce states the drawing is \"... nice.\""

Buffy sulks on a rock, watching the ocean. Cameron Walker, another member of the swim team, approaches Buffy and starts sputtering out poetic words. Buffy tries to scare him off, but he says he's looking to talk. Meanwhile, Jonathan is being dunked in a bucket of ice water by members of the team. Buffy rescues him and scares off the two bullying swimmers. However, Jonathan is angry with Buffy for saving him and tells her to leave him alone. The bullies, Dodd McAlvy and Gage Petronzi, walk off and talk about how weird and scary Buffy is. Dodd suddenly stops, while Gage keeps walking. He smells something bad but goes on anyway. He walks by without seeing Dodd's body, seemingly skinned apart. A mysterious creature walks into the sewer.",

She tells him off, but he doesn't seem to care. After class, Principal Snyder tells Willow that they're still unable to find a replacement for Ms. Calendar, so she'll have to continue substituting for the time being. Willow informs Snyder that Gage is failing because he doesn't show up for tests or do homework. Snyder is not interested; he tells her that, as Gage a member of the swim team, he's under much more pressure than the rest of the students, and demands that she change Gage's grade from an F to a D.",

Snyder happens to see this; he and Cameron blame Buffy for the altercation. Cameron tells Coach Marin, the coach of the swim team, and Snyder that Buffy was leading him on.

Cameron hits the sauna and hears some weird noises, but it's just Coach Marin telling him to hit the showers. While everyone studies in the library, Xander goes out for a drink. Heading for the vending machine, he bumps into Cameron. Xander teases him for getting beaten by Buffy after he tried to paw her. Cameron heads off to the cafeteria for a snack, while Xander tries to decide between grape and orange soda. Cameron screams, and Xander rushes into the cafeteria. He finds the place in shambles, with Cameron's skin on the ground. Xander turns around and finds himself face-to-face with the creature responsible: a Gill Monster.",
                "In the library, Cordelia sketches the creature that Xander saw before running off \"like a woman.\" Buffy and Willow return, having been informed that Cameron and Dodd were the two best swimmers on the team; Gage being the third best. Buffy is assigned to shadowing Gage \u2014 suspecting that he will be attacked next \u2014 while Willow interrogates Jonathan under a lamp. According to Jonathan, he indeed wanted revenge, but he achieved it by peeing in the pool before practice one morning. Xander overhears Marin and Snyder chatting. They need another swimmer, or they won't be eligible for competition; they don't even care if the guy can swim a stroke, as long as he shows up for practice. The next day, Gage grows suspicious of Buffy when she follows him around.",
                "At the Bronze that night, Buffy is confronted by Gage; she attempts to cover it up but fails. She tells him that his life is in danger, but he doesn't believe her and calls her a \"psycho bitch\" and a \"head tripper.\" He leaves, only to encounter Angel in the parking lot. They complain briefly about Buffy, then Angel turns into his vamp face and bites him, intending to sire Gage and recruit him for his war against Buffy. However, Angel quickly stops and spits the blood out. Buffy comes to Gage's rescue and Gage lets Buffy walk him home.",
                "The following day, Buffy sits in on swim practice along with Cordelia and Willow. The three girls wonder what could be killing off the swimmers, and Buffy suspects Gage had steroids in his blood. Cordelia comments on a cute new addition to the team, soon realizing that it's Xander. He walks over and informs them that he just made the team. Willow tells Buffy that Jonathan wasn't responsible for the swimmers' deaths. At the beginning of swim practice, Gage stops in mid-lap to wave and smile at Buffy. Cordelia is delighted that she's dating a member of the Sunnydale swim team, while Buffy and Willow tease him for being almost naked. Later, as the team soaks in the sauna. Xander continues to babble, but no one pays attention. Claws come up through a grate, out of the sight of the team.",
                "While Buffy waits for Gage to exit the boys' locker room, she hears him yell. She charges in and finds him with a Gill Monster. Gage suddenly cries out in pain and falls to the ground: he rips open his shirt, and Buffy watches in horror as he becomes a Gill Monster himself. As Buffy fights the two monsters off, one grabs her from behind and bites her in the arm. Suddenly, Coach Marin saves Buffy just by bursting into the room; although Marin is alone and unarmed, the Gill Monsters flee. Buffy is sent to Nurse Greenliegh's office. Marin is told that members of his team are becoming Gill Monsters. Buffy and Giles go hunting for Gill Monsters in the sewers, but they fail to find any. Meanwhile, Xander again hits the sauna, asking where and how he can get some steroids. His fellow swimmers tell him that he's already getting some, right here and now; it turns out the steroids are in the steam from the sauna.",
                "Nurse Greenliegh tries to end Marin's experiments, as he's been attempting to improve his team's performance with the steroids. To keep her from exposing him, he forces her through a grate into the sewers; there, the Gill Monsters devour her. Xander warns everyone that he's had three exposures to the steam, and is in danger of becoming a Gill Monster himself. Buffy has Giles lock up the rest of the swim team, while she goes to talk with Coach Marin. She confronts him and demands information about the steroids he's been giving them, telling him he'll go to jail. Instead, the coach pulls a gun on Buffy and forces her into the same hole where Nurse Greenliegh was killed. The coach explains to Buffy that, while his monsters have already had their dinner, she's there because \"boys have other needs.\"",
                "Xander enters the locker room to check and see if he's becoming \"scaly.\" A new Gill Monster emerges from the locker room and jumps in the pool. Cordelia, thinking it's Xander, laments about his fate. Xander suddenly reappears beside her, right before the monster of Sean attacks Cordelia. They flee back to the library.",
                "Xander decides that, since Buffy hasn't returned, he should go after her. He meets up with Coach Marin and fights him for the gun. Xander disarms Marin and knocks him out. Xander looks down into the hole and sees Buffy, up to her waist in sewer water, surrounded by Gill Monsters who are about to attack her, so he pulls her out before they can do so. Coach Marin wakes up and bashes Xander's head with a pipe wrench, incapacitating him. Marin tries to do the same with Buffy, but she ducks and trips him; she tries to catch him before he falls into the hole, but misses. Being no match for the Gill Monsters in their element, Buffy can only observe as they approach Marin. Xander recovers just in time to join her in witnessing the coach's demise.",
                "The next day, everyone recaps; Xander and the surviving swim team members are given treatments created by the hospital's toxicology lab that will stop the steroids. Meanwhile, the Gill Monsters swim out into the ocean."

                "At the beach, the Sunnydale High swim team is celebrating their latest victory, while Xander complains about having such a big celebration just for the swim team. Buffy sulks on a rock, watching the ocean. Cameron Walker, another member of the swim team, approaches Buffy and starts sputtering out poetic words. Buffy tries to scare him off, but he says he's looking to talk. Meanwhile, Jonathan is being dunked in a bucket of ice water by members of the team. Buffy rescues him and scares off the two bullying swimmers. However, Jonathan is angry with Buffy for saving him and tells her to leave him alone. The bullies, Dodd McAlvy and Gage Petronzi, walk off and talk about how weird and scary Buffy is. Dodd suddenly stops, while Gage keeps walking. He smells something bad but goes on anyway. He walks by without seeing Dodd's body, seemingly skinned apart. A mysterious creature walks into the sewer.",
                "The next day, Willow is teaching a class, and, as she is walking around checking people's work on their computers, she sees Gage playing solitaire instead. She tells him off, but he doesn't seem to care. After class, Principal Snyder tells Willow that they're still unable to find a replacement for Ms. Calendar, so she'll have to continue substituting for the time being. Willow informs Snyder that Gage is failing because he doesn't show up for tests or do homework. Snyder is not interested; he tells her that, as Gage a member of the swim team, he's under much more pressure than the rest of the students, and demands that she change Gage's grade from an F to a D.",
                "Buffy comes to school with Cameron, and he tries to grope her. She hits his head against the steering wheel and breaks his nose. Snyder happens to see this; he and Cameron blame Buffy for the altercation. Cameron tells Coach Marin, the coach of the swim team, and Snyder that Buffy was leading him on. The coach, after telling Nurse Greenliegh \"take care of my boy,\" turns to Buffy and tells her she shouldn't dress so provocatively.",
                "Later, Buffy rants to Giles and her friends about the incident with Cameron. Giles informs her that they found Dodd's remains on the beach. Cameron hits the sauna and hears some weird noises, but it's just Coach Marin telling him to hit the showers. While everyone studies in the library, Xander goes out for a drink. Heading for the vending machine, he bumps into Cameron. Xander teases him for getting beaten by Buffy after he tried to paw her. Cameron heads off to the cafeteria for a snack, while Xander tries to decide between grape and orange soda. Cameron screams, and Xander rushes into the cafeteria. He finds the place in shambles, with Cameron's skin on the ground. Xander turns around and finds himself face-to-face with the creature responsible: a Gill Monster.",
                "In the library, Cordelia sketches the creature that Xander saw before running off \"like a woman.\" Buffy and Willow return, having been informed that Cameron and Dodd were the two best swimmers on the team; Gage being the third best. Buffy is assigned to shadowing Gage \u2014 suspecting that he will be attacked next \u2014 while Willow interrogates Jonathan under a lamp. According to Jonathan, he indeed wanted revenge, but he achieved it by peeing in the pool before practice one morning. Xander overhears Marin and Snyder chatting. They need another swimmer, or they won't be eligible for competition; they don't even care if the guy can swim a stroke, as long as he shows up for practice. The next day, Gage grows suspicious of Buffy when she follows him around.",
                "At the Bronze that night, Buffy is confronted by Gage; she attempts to cover it up but fails. She tells him that his life is in danger, but he doesn't believe her and calls her a \"psycho bitch\" and a \"head tripper.\" He leaves, only to encounter Angel in the parking lot. They complain briefly about Buffy, then Angel turns into his vamp face and bites him, intending to sire Gage and recruit him for his war against Buffy. However, Angel quickly stops and spits the blood out. Buffy comes to Gage's rescue and Gage lets Buffy walk him home.",
                "The following day, Buffy sits in on swim practice along with Cordelia and Willow. The three girls wonder what could be killing off the swimmers, and Buffy suspects Gage had steroids in his blood. Cordelia comments on a cute new addition to the team, soon realizing that it's Xander. He walks over and informs them that he just made the team. Willow tells Buffy that Jonathan wasn't responsible for the swimmers' deaths. At the beginning of swim practice, Gage stops in mid-lap to wave and smile at Buffy. Cordelia is delighted that she's dating a member of the Sunnydale swim team, while Buffy and Willow tease him for being almost naked. Later, as the team soaks in the sauna. Xander continues to babble, but no one pays attention. Claws come up through a grate, out of the sight of the team.",
                "While Buffy waits for Gage to exit the boys' locker room, she hears him yell. She charges in and finds him with a Gill Monster. Gage suddenly cries out in pain and falls to the ground: he rips open his shirt, and Buffy watches in horror as he becomes a Gill Monster himself. As Buffy fights the two monsters off, one grabs her from behind and bites her in the arm. Suddenly, Coach Marin saves Buffy just by bursting into the room; although Marin is alone and unarmed, the Gill Monsters flee. Buffy is sent to Nurse Greenliegh's office. Marin is told that members of his team are becoming Gill Monsters. Buffy and Giles go hunting for Gill Monsters in the sewers, but they fail to find any. Meanwhile, Xander again hits the sauna, asking where and how he can get some steroids. His fellow swimmers tell him that he's already getting some, right here and now; it turns out the steroids are in the steam from the sauna.",
                "Nurse Greenliegh tries to end Marin's experiments, as he's been attempting to improve his team's performance with the steroids. To keep her from exposing him, he forces her through a grate into the sewers; there, the Gill Monsters devour her. Xander warns everyone that he's had three exposures to the steam, and is in danger of becoming a Gill Monster himself. Buffy has Giles lock up the rest of the swim team, while she goes to talk with Coach Marin. She confronts him and demands information about the steroids he's been giving them, telling him he'll go to jail. Instead, the coach pulls a gun on Buffy and forces her into the same hole where Nurse Greenliegh was killed. The coach explains to Buffy that, while his monsters have already had their dinner, she's there because \"boys have other needs.\"",
                "Xander enters the locker room to check and see if he's becoming \"scaly.\" A new Gill Monster emerges from the locker room and jumps in the pool. Cordelia, thinking it's Xander, laments about his fate. Xander suddenly reappears beside her, right before the monster of Sean attacks Cordelia. They flee back to the library.",
                "Xander decides that, since Buffy hasn't returned, he should go after her. He meets up with Coach Marin and fights him for the gun. Xander disarms Marin and knocks him out. Xander looks down into the hole and sees Buffy, up to her waist in sewer water, surrounded by Gill Monsters who are about to attack her, so he pulls her out before they can do so. Coach Marin wakes up and bashes Xander's head with a pipe wrench, incapacitating him. Marin tries to do the same with Buffy, but she ducks and trips him; she tries to catch him before he falls into the hole, but misses. Being no match for the Gill Monsters in their element, Buffy can only observe as they approach Marin. Xander recovers just in time to join her in witnessing the coach's demise.",
                "The next day, everyone recaps; Xander and the surviving swim team members are given treatments created by the hospital's toxicology lab that will stop the steroids. Meanwhile, the Gill Monsters swim out into the ocean."

As she walks down the street, a policeman recognizes her and tries to arrest her, but Spike shows up and knocks him out. After a exchanging punches, he strikes a deal with her: he will help stop Angel if she allows him and Drusilla to leave town. Spike explains that while vampires may love to talk about destroying the world among themselves, he prefers the world as it is. Moreover, he cannot stand the way Drusilla acts around Angel.

Spike expresses surprise and pride that Dru \"bagged a Slayer,\" but then realizes that this is probably not the best thing to say in front of Buffy. He insists that Buffy will get no help from him if Dru is harmed, and she accepts these terms but she warns that Drusilla only walks if Giles survives. Spike leaves the house and in a dramatic argument, Joyce insists Buffy must tell her everything, and tries to prevent her from leaving.

Angel agrees and compliments Spike on his seemingly clever thinking.",

Blood opens it, blood closes it. He says with great significance that the quicker she kills Angel, the easier it will be. She says it will be no problem \u2014 she has already lost everything. After she leaves, Whistler says she's got one more thing to lose. On her way to the mansion, Xander arrives with Willow's message, but decides to tell Buffy that Willow said to \"kick his ass.\" Buffy asks him to free Giles while she deals with Angel.

As Acathla starts to awaken, Spike knocks a dismayed Drusilla unconscious and is carrying her from the fray. On his way out, Spike sees Angel approaching an unarmed Buffy with a sword and believes that Angel is actually going to kill Buffy. He shrugs and leaves. Angel notes that Buffy is all alone, with no weapons and no friends. He asks her what is left, and thrusts his sword at her head. Eyes closed, she stops the blade with her hands. She opens up her eyes and says: \"me.\" At the same time, a weakened Willow is performing the restoration ritual and falls into a trance. Her friends watch as she starts reciting with ease.",

As Buffy is about to land the killing blow, suddenly Angel's soul is restored. He is confused and doesn't understand what is happening. However, the ensoulment has come too late; Acathla opens his mouth and a vortex begins to expand outward. Angel hears something behind him, but Buffy reassures him that everything is fine. After a final kiss, Buffy tells Angel to close his eyes. When he complies, she stabs Angel into the vortex. Angel says \"Buffy?\" and extends his arm. She watches as he is sucked into Acathla's dimension and the vortex closes behind him, then she begins to weep.",

                "The police visit an incredulous Joyce, informing her that Buffy is a wanted fugitive for Kendra's murder. Joyce tries to protest, insisting that there is some mistake. She mentions that Buffy is supposed to be with her friend Willow, and the police tell her that Willow is one of the other victims. They also remind Joyce of Buffy's violent history, and ask Joyce to contact them if she hears from her daughter.",
                "Buffy finds Whistler in Giles' apartment and they discuss Angel. He tells her no one foresaw Buffy, that Angel was supposed to be stopping Acathla, not bringing him forth, but that was before Buffy erased his soul. He asks her what she intends to do about this, and tells her that in the end, she's all she's got. As she leaves, he tells her blessed sword is not enough, that she must know how to use it. As she walks down the street, a policeman recognizes her and tries to arrest her, but Spike shows up and knocks him out. After a exchanging punches, he strikes a deal with her: he will help stop Angel if she allows him and Drusilla to leave town. Spike explains that while vampires may love to talk about destroying the world among themselves, he prefers the world as it is. Moreover, he cannot stand the way Drusilla acts around Angel. While Buffy is unimpressed by his speech, he reminds her that they have her Watcher, Spike is all she has got, and that neither of them can fight both Angel and Dru alone.",
                "Buffy accepts the ceasefire and decides to talk with Spike inside her home, but she is intercepted in the driveway by her mother, who demands to know what is going on. Spike is surprised and amused to discover that Joyce has no idea that Buffy is the Slayer. When Joyce demands to know what is going on, Buffy tries to cover by saying that she and Spike were in a band together. However, the three are attacked by a vampire sent by Angel to follow Spike, and Joyce watches in shock as Buffy slays the creature. After this display, Buffy is forced to explain her destiny as the Slayer to her mother, who has significant difficulty accepting the truth.",
                "In the hospital, Xander tells a comatose Willow that he loves her. She wakes and asks for Oz, who appears in the room. She tells him that her head feels \"big\" and asks him if it is, in fact, big, and he responds, \"No, it's head-sized.\"",
                "Back at the Summers home, there is an awkward silence between Joyce and Spike. Joyce recognizes him from somewhere and asks him about it. Spike, cheerfully, says she hit him on the head with an axe once. Both are very happy when Buffy shows up, getting them out of their awkward silence. Buffy says she'll accept Spike's offer, although she is hesitant to let Dru walk because she killed Kendra. Spike expresses surprise and pride that Dru \"bagged a Slayer,\" but then realizes that this is probably not the best thing to say in front of Buffy. He insists that Buffy will get no help from him if Dru is harmed, and she accepts these terms but she warns that Drusilla only walks if Giles survives. Spike leaves the house and in a dramatic argument, Joyce insists Buffy must tell her everything, and tries to prevent her from leaving. Buffy tells her mom that she wishes she could be a normal teenager, but that she has to go save the world, again. Joyce tells her daughter not to come back if she leaves the house. Buffy looks shaken, yet leaves without hesitation.",
                "On her hospital bed, Willow, despite protest from Xander, decides to try the curse again. She sends Oz and Cordelia after her supplies, which had been left in the library after the attack. She sends Xander to tell Buffy her plans, hoping she can stall until the curse is complete.",
                "Spike, back in his wheelchair, discovers a frustrated Angel on the verge of killing Giles, who has withstood extensive torture without revealing his knowledge of the ritual. Spike, who must keep Giles alive so that Buffy will let Dru leave, uses reason to persuade Angel not to kill Giles. Spike suggests another way of getting the information and asks Dru if she wants to play a game.",
                "Buffy returns to the library to retrieve Kendra's sword, where she runs into Snyder, who expels her, even though he knows that she is not the murderer. She insists that the truth will be revealed, and he points out that the law enforcement authorities in Sunnydale are \"deeply stupid.\" Buffy pulls Kendra's sword out and says: \"You never ever got a single date when you were in high school, did you?\" After she leaves, Snyder calls the Mayor with \"the good news\" of her expulsion.",
                "Drusilla uses her psychic powers to read Giles and discover his weakness. She cajoles the information she wants by hypnotizing him so that she appears as Jenny in his eyes. He reveals that Angel must use his own blood, not someone else's, to awaken Acathla. Angel orders Giles killed, but Spike is able to put this off by claiming he could be lying. Angel agrees and compliments Spike on his seemingly clever thinking.",
                "Buffy, now wearing the crucifix Angel gave her when they first met, returns to Whistler to ask him about how to defeat Acathla, who tells her Angel's blood will send both evil beings back to hell. Blood opens it, blood closes it. He says with great significance that the quicker she kills Angel, the easier it will be. She says it will be no problem \u2014 she has already lost everything. After she leaves, Whistler says she's got one more thing to lose. On her way to the mansion, Xander arrives with Willow's message, but decides to tell Buffy that Willow said to \"kick his ass.\" Buffy asks him to free Giles while she deals with Angel. Chaos reigns inside the mansion as Spike leaves his wheelchair and attacks Angel with a crowbar, but Drusilla subsequently attacks him while Xander rescues Giles.",
                "During the fight, Angel recovers before Buffy can defeat his vampire lackey and successfully removes the sword from Acathla. He and Buffy begin to duel, both going for the kill, with Angel eventually gaining the upper hand. As Acathla starts to awaken, Spike knocks a dismayed Drusilla unconscious and is carrying her from the fray. On his way out, Spike sees Angel approaching an unarmed Buffy with a sword and believes that Angel is actually going to kill Buffy. He shrugs and leaves. Angel notes that Buffy is all alone, with no weapons and no friends. He asks her what is left, and thrusts his sword at her head. Eyes closed, she stops the blade with her hands. She opens up her eyes and says: \"me.\" At the same time, a weakened Willow is performing the restoration ritual and falls into a trance. Her friends watch as she starts reciting with ease.",
                "Spike embraces Drusilla while he drives away in his car. Buffy fights ferociously, and quickly backs Angel up against the statue just as Willow finally succeeds with the Ritual of Restoration; the Orb of Thesulah glows and vanishes. As Buffy is about to land the killing blow, suddenly Angel's soul is restored. He is confused and doesn't understand what is happening. However, the ensoulment has come too late; Acathla opens his mouth and a vortex begins to expand outward. Angel hears something behind him, but Buffy reassures him that everything is fine. After a final kiss, Buffy tells Angel to close his eyes. When he complies, she stabs Angel into the vortex. Angel says \"Buffy?\" and extends his arm. She watches as he is sucked into Acathla's dimension and the vortex closes behind him, then she begins to weep.",
                "Joyce finds a note on Buffy's bed, noticing that her clothes have been strewn everywhere and her closet emptied. The Scooby Gang gathers in front of the school speculating on what happened between Buffy and Angel, as all they know is that Acathla was stopped. Unbeknownst to them, Buffy is watching from a distance. She turns and boards a bus. As the bus leaves, a road sign reads: \"Now leaving Sunnydale. Come back soon!\""

Her friend does not show up, and Buffy goes home and meets Pat, a book club member of Joyce's who openly comments Buffy's recent behavior and its impact on Joyce.

Giles leaves for the library, and Buffy gets ready to head there with him, but he stops her explaining that she is no longer allowed on school grounds. Later in the library, the gang discuss various \"welcome back\" dinner scenarios for Buffy, but convince themselves that a big party would be more appropriate.

Cordelia attempts to talk about Buffy's perspective, and Oz tries to keep everyone calm. As the tension escalates, the newly reanimated zombies crash through the windows and doors, interrupting the Scoobies' argument and making them band together to combat the threat.

Buffy pushes the newly demonized Pat out of the window shortly before it could kill Willow. Oz tries to tell Buffy about how to kill it, when he is hypnotized. Buffy uses this opening to plunge a shovel into Pat demon's eyes, depowering and killing it. It vanishes along with all the other zombies.

They're surprised at her sudden and unannounced return. They all head to Giles' apartment, surprising him as well. Later, the group discuss the news that Buffy is no longer wanted for Kendra's murder and speculate on where Buffy went during the summer. Meanwhile, Giles smiles in relief to see Buffy again.",
                "The next day, Joyce takes Buffy to see Principal Snyder, who takes vindictive pleasure in keeping Buffy from re-entering Sunnydale High School, even though she no longer has criminal charges against her. In the car, Joyce discusses the idea of sending Buffy to a private school before dropping her off at the Espresso Pump coffee shop for a scheduled meeting with Willow. Her friend does not show up, and Buffy goes home and meets Pat, a book club member of Joyce's who openly comments Buffy's recent behavior and its impact on Joyce. While fetching fancy \"company\" plates for a dinner with her friends that Joyce arranged, Buffy finds a dead cat in the basement, which Buffy and Joyce bury. Later that night, the Nigerian mask's eyes glow red, and the dead cat crawls its way out of the grave.",
                "Buffy dreams about Angel. The next morning, she and Joyce discuss her schooling options, and Joyce suggests that Buffy should tell a few people such as Principal Snyder and the police that she is the Slayer. The dead cat then enters the kitchen, surprising them. Giles comes over and remove it in a cage, when he notices the mask on the wall. Giles leaves for the library, and Buffy gets ready to head there with him, but he stops her explaining that she is no longer allowed on school grounds. Later in the library, the gang discuss various \"welcome back\" dinner scenarios for Buffy, but convince themselves that a big party would be more appropriate. Giles, who is doing research on Buffy's reanimated cat, is distracted by the discussion and overlooks a page in his book showing Joyce's Nigerian mask.",
                "As Buffy prepares for dinner with her friends, the Dingoes Ate My Baby band arrives at Buffy's house without notice and many people from school that she barely knows. Overwhelmed by all of the partygoers, Buffy tries to talk to Willow, but she can't hear her well standing so close to the band. Buffy then tries to talk with Xander and Cordelia, but they are too busy kissing each other. Meanwhile, Joyce is telling Pat in the kitchen how much it means to her to have Buffy back, though it has been harder on her than expected. Overhearing them, Buffy goes upstairs and decides to pack her things again.",
                "At the library, Giles is horrified when he finally finds information on the mask. He tries to phone Buffy's house, but the partygoer who answer the phone fails to properly understand and relay his message with the loud music playing.",
                "Willow finds Buffy in the bedroom and argues with her when she notices that Buffy is trying to leave again. Willow accuses Buffy of just giving up on Sunnydale and for not being there for her during a summer when she needed her help, mentioning big life developments such as dating Oz and dabbling in magic. Willow also accuses Buffy of being so worried about people being angry with her that she didn't bother to ask anyone else how they were doing.",
                "Giles decides to drive to the party, angrily talking to himself about Joyce's decision to hang a cursed mask as decoration. Suddenly, he accidentally hits a man standing in the road. Giles gets out of his car and discovers that the man is a reanimated corpse. Giles barely escapes oncoming zombies as other dead bodies rise all over Sunnydale.",
                "Joyce walks in on Buffy packing to run away again and they go downstairs, where she continues to chastise Buffy regardless of the people watching them. Joyce argues that her daughter is willing to put her through the misery of not knowing where she is again. Xander decides to weigh in the discussion, telling Buffy that running away was selfish. Cordelia attempts to talk about Buffy's perspective, and Oz tries to keep everyone calm. As the tension escalates, the newly reanimated zombies crash through the windows and doors, interrupting the Scoobies' argument and making them band together to combat the threat. Meanwhile, several guests are killed and become zombies themselves. Oz and Cordelia hide in a downstairs closet, while Buffy and others rush upstairs with a gravely-injured Pat.",
                "Giles arrives to tell Oz and Cordelia about the mask containing the powers of the zombie demon Ovu Mobani, which means \"evil eye.\" He explains that whichever zombie puts it on becomes the demon incarnate. At that moment, Pat stands up and wears the mask, making other zombies cower down. Buffy soon realizes that the demon's gaze hypnotizes whoever is looking at it when its eyes flash. Buffy pushes the newly demonized Pat out of the window shortly before it could kill Willow. Oz tries to tell Buffy about how to kill it, when he is hypnotized. Buffy uses this opening to plunge a shovel into Pat demon's eyes, depowering and killing it. It vanishes along with all the other zombies. With the demon's defeat, Joyce and the Scoobies reunite again, and the entire group embraces.",
                "The next day, Giles tries to convince Snyder to let Buffy return. When Snyder refuses, Giles warns him that he will take things up with the state supreme court and make life very difficult for him, \"professionally.\" When Snyder still resists, Giles physically intimidates him and asks if he wants to be convinced.",
                "Meanwhile in the coffee shop, Willow tells Buffy about her dabbling in magic. Buffy apologizes for not being there for her, and Willow forgives her, teasing Buffy about having to be \"grownup about it.\" The two then engage into a playful duel of insults."

When Angel picks it up the dream becomes a flashback of Buffy killing him. He clenches the ring in his fingers until blood runs between his fingers, and blood also starts to stain his white shirt, exactly where Buffy had to impale him.

He lays out some conditions, but it seems they're not actually requirements for readmission, simply Snyder's cruelty toward an unwanted pupil. He tells her she has to take make-up tests, see the school psychologist and get a glowing letter of recommendation from a member of the faculty (other than Giles). But Buffy and Joyce both know that Snyder has been overruled, and while is happy enough to point out his position probably feels meaningless now, Joyce takes a more childish approach to express her delight.",

Faith wants to hear a story from Buffy, but is quickly distracted when Xander asks for the \"alligator story.\" When Buffy is asked what her toughest kill was, she flashes back to killing Angel, but says that they are all difficult.

Mrs. Summers says that Faith could share in the slaying though, and that they could even ask Faith to take over.

She seems to be on her way to resolving her issues, but on patrol that night, Angel tackles her in the woods. Animalistic, he is no match for Buffy, who chains him up in the Crawford Street mansion.

He goes on to explain that with time passing differently in Hell anybody who returned would have endured seemingly endless torture.

Meanwhile, Faith and Buffy are making a sweep around Sunnydale. Faith displays a cynical view of males, while Buffy dodges her questions. They talk about Scott and how much Buffy likes him, but is still planning to take it slow on account of her previous history with men. A boy, Jeffrey Walken, is attacked brutally in the woods.",
                "The next day, Buffy talks to Scott and his friends, Debbie and Pete, who are also a couple. Buffy reveals that she has to go and see Mr. Platt, the school psychologist. Debbie sees him, too, because she has \"success issues.\" Buffy gives Scott a quick kiss goodbye and leaves for her appointment.",

She finds in him an understanding figure \u2014 unlike Debbie's description \u2014 and begins to open up to him more and more. She seems to be on her way to resolving her issues, but on patrol that night, Angel tackles her in the woods. Animalistic, he is no match for Buffy, who chains him up in the Crawford Street mansion. He growls at her like an animal. She discovers the spot on the floor where she left his Claddagh ring; it was scorched by Angel's body on his return.",
                "At the same time, Willow, Xander\u00a0and Cordy enter the morgue to inspect the mauled body. Willow\u00a0seems the only one unfazed, but she faints as soon as she is done collecting her samples.",

Buffy sends Faith away and spends the night searching for answers about the return of Angel. The next morning, Giles finds her asleep around books about demon dimensions and Acathla. She tells him she had a really vivid dream that Angel came back. Giles doubts it could happen, there being no record of such an event. He goes on to explain that with time passing differently in Hell anybody who returned would have endured seemingly endless torture. Only with extraordinary character would one be able to have retained any semblance of ones self. Most likely they would've become a monster. Willow arrives to inform them that her investigation was not conclusive. Buffy is anxious as she wonders if Angel was responsible.",

He tells her that he needed the substance before to turn into the monster, but now her grating voice is already enough for him to transform. He begins beating Debbie, then apologizes, turning back into his human self. She forgives him.",

Spike says that he is \"nothing without her,\" which Buffy agrees, calling him pathetic. Spike retorts by saying that they sicken him; the last time he had seen them, they were fighting to the death, but now they were acting as if nothing had happened.

Xander demands a third option, so Willow suggests that Spike might have gotten so drunk that he will pass out and forget about them, leaving them to starve to death; she notes that this last possibility is their best option. Deciding that the high probability of death is a mitigating factor, Willow and Xander kiss, just in time for Oz and Cordelia to find them.

After killing a few, they retreat back into the shop and barricade themselves in, fighting the vampires who get inside. Lenny insults Spike, making him beat and stake him in response. Eventually, Angel and Buffy use bottled holy water to scare off the remaining vampires. Spike, inspired and refreshed by the thrill of the fight, realizes that the only way he is going to get Dru back is if he becomes the man he once was, the man she loved.

                "Spike sneaks into the back of Uncle Bob's Magic Cabinet shop during the day in search of a curse for Angel. He tells the clerk he wants something really nasty, like boils or leprosy, something that would \"make his parts fall off.\" The woman then turns to attend Willow, who is looking for ingredients for a \"de-lusting\" spell. As she and the clerk discuss ingredients, Spike, out of their sight, pays close attention; when Willow leaves, Spike kills the shopkeeper, having decided that a love spell for Drusilla would be \"an even better idea.\"",
                "Later that day, Mayor Wilkins is practicing golf putting in his office, when his deputy Allan Finch alerts him to their \"Spike problem.\" The deputy suggests that Trick organize and send a \"committee\" to deal with the problem, the Mayor, after a few asides ranging from offering the deputy's soul for \"one good short game\" to whether \"allowing a loose cannon to rock the boat\" is a mixed metaphor, good-humoredly agrees.",
                "At school, the night of the double date, Willow is in the chemistry lab, working on the ingredients for her anti-love spell. Xander shows up and they begin arguing when he figures out what Willow is doing. Spike comes in, still very drunk, and attacks Xander, announcing that he needs to borrow Willow for a while. Spike takes Xander, unconscious from a head wound, and Willow back to the factory, where he locks them up. Spike explains his situation to Willow, first threatening her life if she fails to cast an effective spell. He then sits next to her and tells Willow that Dru had thought he had gone soft after his alliance with Buffy and was not \"demon enough\" for her anymore. The final blow had come when he caught Dru cheating on him with a chaos demon and she told him that they could still be friends. Willow tries to half-heartedly comfort the distraught Spike. She then tells him that she doesn't have enough ingredients, so he takes her list and goes to collect what she needs.",
                "At the library, Buffy is working out when Cordelia and Oz show up, worried because the lab is torn up and Willow and Xander are gone. Buffy's mom calls her, then Buffy hears over the line Spike say \"Hello Joyce.\" Joyce offers him hot chocolate and advice, while he relates the details of his breakup with Dru and asks if she has any of \"those little marshmallows.\" Outside, Angel spots them talking in the kitchen, but cannot enter the house because he is not invited. Joyce backs away accusing him of being evil, while Spike taunts him. Buffy suddenly arrives, pins Spike to the table, and invites Angel in. Spike tells them he's got her friends, so the three of them should leave to get the supplies for the love spell to be cast, then he'd set Buffy's friends free. On the way to the shop, Spike is afflicted with pain from finally starting to sober up and reminisces on memories of Drusilla. Buffy offers to stake Spike to put him out of his misery, but Angel tells her that they still need him to find her friends; Buffy counters that he probably just locked them in the factory, despite Spike's protests that he is not that \"thick.\"",
                "As Oz and Cordelia are driving, Oz catches Willow's scent, \"a residual werewolf thing,\" and can tell that she is afraid. Cordelia declares it to be creepy, and Oz admits that he agrees.",
                "Spike, Buffy, and Angel are getting the supplies. Angel comments that he's going to a lot of trouble for the sake of the fickle Drusilla, so Spike takes a swing at him before blaming the two of them for their break-up. Spike says that he is \"nothing without her,\" which Buffy agrees, calling him pathetic. Spike retorts by saying that they sicken him; the last time he had seen them, they were fighting to the death, but now they were acting as if nothing had happened. They insist that they are just friends now, but Spike tells them: \"You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends.\"",
                "Xander wakes up to find that he and Willow are locked in the basement of the factory. They discuss what will happen to them: Willow explains that either she casts the spell and Spike kills them, or she refuses to cast the spell and Spike kills them. Xander demands a third option, so Willow suggests that Spike might have gotten so drunk that he will pass out and forget about them, leaving them to starve to death; she notes that this last possibility is their best option. Deciding that the high probability of death is a mitigating factor, Willow and Xander kiss, just in time for Oz and Cordelia to find them. Cordelia is horrified and runs up the stairs, but they collapse and she falls through, impaling herself on a piece of metal rebar sticking out of the rubble-covered floor below.",
                "As Buffy, Angel, and Spike leave with the supplies, they are surrounded by a group of Mr. Trick's vampires, led by one of Spike's former lackeys, Lenny. Spike points out that if Buffy and Angel leave him to die, then Willow and Xander die too. Buffy reluctantly joins the brawl. After killing a few, they retreat back into the shop and barricade themselves in, fighting the vampires who get inside. Lenny insults Spike, making him beat and stake him in response. Eventually, Angel and Buffy use bottled holy water to scare off the remaining vampires. Spike, inspired and refreshed by the thrill of the fight, realizes that the only way he is going to get Dru back is if he becomes the man he once was, the man she loved. He tells Angel and Buffy that their friends are at the factory and that he is going to \"find Dru, tie her up, and torture her until she likes [him] again.\" As he leaves the shop, he sticks his head back in to note: \"Love's a funny thing.\"",
                "Cordelia survives the fall; none of her vital organs are hurt. When Xander brings flowers to Cordelia in the hospital, she tells him to stay away from her. Willow tells Buffy that Oz refuses to talk to her, and Buffy suggests time, patience, and groveling. Buffy visits Angel and tells him that they are not friends; she explains that she is not coming back, because he does not need her help anymore, and she cannot maintain the lie about their friendship to herself \u2014 \"or Spike, for some reason.\" Angel protests, but Buffy tells him that the only way they can see each other is if he tells her that he does not love her, something he cannot do.",
                "Buffy, Angel, Cordelia, Xander, Willow, and Oz broods in their own way, mourning for their broken relationships. Meanwhile, Spike is back on the road, smoking and singing along with the music on the radio, as his car travels along the desert highway."

                "Buffy, Willow, and Xander are in the park, where they were attacked by a demon. After they slay it, they discuss the fallout of Xander and Willow's kiss. Xander says he's left many voicemails on Cordelia's phone, but she has yet to return his calls. Willow admits that she feels terrible about what happened and that the idea of Oz not speaking to her again upsets her more. Xander asks Buffy, who's also feeling low after severing ties with Angel, how she's coping. She responds that she finds comfort in her friends.",
                "Cordelia is in her bedroom, with the wound from her impaling still fresh. She goes through pictures of Xander, cutting up and burning them, as she listens to his countless messages.",
                "At school the next morning, Willow hangs around near Oz's locker, hoping to catch him. She tells Buffy that Amy saw Cordelia at the mall, looking \"scary.\" Outside school, Cordelia pulls up in her car. Dressed to impress, and trying to appear as confident as possible, she strides through school until she runs into Harmony and her clique. Cordelia is surprised when Harmony seemingly welcomes her back into the group with open arms. She is then introduced to Anya, a new girl at school. Harmony tells Cordelia that she needs to get back into the dating game, and tells her about a \"stallion,\" who turns out to be Jonathan. The group laughs and walk away from Cordelia, with Anya close behind.",
                "As Oz gets books from his locker, Willow runs up and starts apologizing for everything. Oz tells her she's already said it all, and Willow asks if there's anything she can do. Oz tells her to leave him alone as he needs time to figure out where their relationship stands, and it's not his problem that she's feeling guilty nor is it his responsibility to make her feel better. He walks away.",
                "Cordelia spots Xander walking towards her and asks a random jock named John Lee to come near her. She actually asks if she has anything in her teeth, but she makes it appear that, from Xander's point of view, the two are kissing. As Xander walks away, John Lee tells Cordelia that he can't risk being caught speaking to \"Xander Harris' cast-off,\" but if she'd like to find a dark corner so they could make out he's okay with that. He tells her to think about it and quickly leaves. Cordelia then runs into Anya, who admits that she doesn't like Harmony, dismissing her tendency to say whatever she thinks is \"cool\" at the moment. The two quickly befriend each other, united in their general disdain for men.",
                "At the Bronze that evening, Cordelia and Anya hang out with a group of people. Xander, sitting with Willow and Buffy, pretends to laugh and begs his two friends to help. Buffy tells Xander that, although she supports him, she won't takes sides against Cordelia, and Willow says she agrees with Buffy, and that Cordelia is in the right since she was one of the aggrieved people. Plus she's still upset about Oz. Xander declares that he's sick of feeling guilty and is ready to pick himself up. Buffy and Willow agree, but their enthusiasm quickly fades. Buffy says it didn't work and asks they want chocolate. When she's gone Xander starts ranting about Cordelia. He grabs Willow's hand and she tells him to remove his hand from her. He apologizes but then asks why he's apologizing saying they've always been friends. Willow explains that she wants to work things out with Oz so they can no longer be like that anymore.",
                "While at the bar grabbing drinks, Buffy sees Cordelia moving toward the door and decides to follow. Outside, Cordy accuses her of being sent by Xander, but Buffy explains that it was her own choice to come. She tells Cordelia that she understands how much Cordelia is hurting, and how she felt better after talking with friends. Suddenly, a vampire attacks and Buffy makes quick work of it, but in the scuffle Cordelia is pushed into a pile of garbage. Harmony and her friends come out of the Bronze and spot Cordelia, covered in garbage, and laugh at her. Cordelia declares that all of her bad luck over the last couple of years is Buffy's fault.",
                "In the next morning, Cordelia tells Anya about the Bronze incident, revealing that her fall into the garbage popped some of the stitches on her torso. Anya gives Cordelia her necklace, which she calls a \"good luck charm,\" and agrees with Cordelia's complaints. As Buffy, Willow and Xander sit nearby, Cordelia tells Anya: \"I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale.\" Anya suddenly turns around in full demon visage and says\u00a0\"Done,\" with a sudden flash of bright light. When it clears, Anya is gone, and so are the majority of the students. Cordelia, now injury-free, realizes that Anya is a \"good fairy\" that granted her wish. In the hallway, Cordelia bumps into Harmony and company, who are her friends again as they gossip about the other students. One of the girls comments on Cordelia's \"daring\" outfit, as the rest are wearing dark clothing. Just then, John Lee approaches Cordelia and asks if she'll go with him to the upcoming Winter Brunch. Cordelia doesn't know what the event is, but sarcastically tells John that she'll get back to him.",
                "In class, which is populated by less than a half of the normal amount of students, the teacher reminds them that there will be no classes the next day due to the monthly memorial, and he bolts for the door. Cordelia asks Harmony, who is also rushing out, what the hurry is. Harmony explains that her mother worries when she's late home, and she wants to get back before curfew starts in an hour. Cordelia is confused and suggests going to the Bronze, which the girls think is a sick joke. Harmony then asks Cordelia if everything is okay, because she's acting strange. Cordelia claims that she's having trouble remembering things, and asks if Xander and Willow are miserable. Harmony confirms, telling Cordelia that they're both dead.",
                "Heading to the parking lot at dusk, Cordelia finds it empty. She asks the janitor what's going on, and he explains that students aren't allowed to drive, suggesting that she get home before sunset. Walking through the main street, she finds\u00a0all the businesses are closed and the place is almost deserted. She suddenly runs into Xander and Willow, dressed in dark leather clothing. Cordelia is relieved to see them and admits that Sunnydale was much better with Buffy around. Willow, wrapping her arms around Xander, says that she's bored and ready to feed. They kiss, much to Cordelia's dismay, but she gets even more of a shock when she realizes the two are vampires. She runs away, but doesn't get far before Xander knocks her out. However, before he can feed, Giles, Oz, and Larry turn up armed with crosses and weapons. They keep the two vampires at bay as they gather Cordelia and leave in Oz's van. In the library, the three, along with another member named Nancy, notice Cordelia's bright clothing, something known to attract vampires. Giles then sends them out to watch the perimeter.",
                "Xander and Willow head to the Bronze, a vampire hangout with caged humans. In the back area, the two speak to their ruler, the Master. He picks up a girl he had just tried to feed on, telling them he couldn't because she kept looking at him. He tosses her to Willow, who picks up where he left off. The Master asks for a report, and Xander tells him of their near-kill before the \"White Hats\" stopped them. The Master promises that Giles will soon be dealt with. Xander then mentions that Cordelia mentioned \"the slayer.\" The Master tells him it's especially important to keep Slayers out with the opening of \"the plant\" less than a day away, and orders the two to kill Cordelia or else, since she spoke of summoning a Slayer.",
                "In the library, Cordelia wakes up telling Giles it was all because she made a stupid wish, but Giles assumes she's hysterical. However, Cordelia then asks him why he is in Sunnydale when Buffy isn't, given that he was her Watcher. Giles is confused because he's never revealed his Watcher status to anyone. A noise outside catches his attention, and he enters the cage to grab weapons as he asks Cordelia to start over. However, the cage shuts behind him, as Xander and Willow arrive. Locking Giles in, the two bite Cordelia and drink of her blood. They depart and leaving Cordelia's corpse fallen on the ground. Finally kicking his way out of the cage, Giles meets up with a battered Oz and Larry who tell him that Willow and Xander surprised them. Nancy is dead. Giles has the two take Cordelia's body to the incinerator. However, he notices Cordelia's necklace and removes it before they take her away.",
                "As the Master pours himself some blood from an espresso machine, Xander and Willow arrive and report their success. Willow tells the Master that she's been good, and he allows her to play with the \"puppy.\" In his apartment, Giles makes a call to the Slayer's Watcher and explains he needs to meet with her. However, he learns that the Slayer doesn't check in with her Watcher often because she's so busy, so Giles leaves a message before going back to research.",
                "Willow heads into an area where a figure is lying in a cage. Willow talks to the prisoner about how much she hates daylight, but now she's allowed to play. The man in the cage doesn't answer, so Willow enters and yanks his head back, revealing the prisoner to be Angel. She opens his shirt to reveal several large open sores. Willow boasts that the people Angel tried to save will die that evening, but it'll be quick, which is more than can be said for Angel. Xander tosses Willow some matches and tells her that he's more than happy to watch. Willow lights a match and prepares to have fun.",
                "With the necklace in hands, Giles finds references to a demon named Anyanka, the patron saint of scorned women. Larry asks what she does, and Giles explains that Anyanka grants wishes. He then remembers Cordelia saying that the world was meant to be different. He sends Oz and Larry home as he prepares to look through more research materials. Driving back to his apartment, Giles spots vampires herding several people into a truck. He attacks and frees the citizens but cannot fight off the vampires. As he lies on the ground, he suddenly hears a scuffle and the vampires are slain. Looking up, he sees a battle-hardened girl, who confirms that she is Buffy Summers and asks him what she's doing there.",
                "Taking Buffy to his house, Giles explains that Anyanka's power lies in her power center and, if it is destroyed, all the wishes she's ever granted will be reversed. Buffy is uninterested and simply asks how to kill her, but Giles explains that it isn't necessary. Giles tells her that the Master is the supreme vampire in the town and is planning something for that evening. The Slayer immediately sets out to kill him. Giles tells her she'll need a plan, but she isn't interested and demands to know where the Master lives. Buffy goes to the Bronze to find it completely deserted. Heading into the basement, she finds Angel cowering in the cage. He recognizes her and tells her that he waited for her but she never came. When the Master rose from the Hellmouth, Angel was imprisoned. He asks to be released so he can help her, and Buffy, tired of being regarded as Sunnydale's savior, moves to free him. However, when Angel recoils from her cross pendant, Buffy realizes he's a vampire. She balks at the idea of releasing him, thinking he's leading her into a trap. Angel shows her his scars, explaining that if nothing else is true: he wants the Master dead.",
                "At the plant, the Master gives a speech in front of an assembled throng of vampires as Willow and Xander stand at his side. In a nearby holding area, human prisoners, including the newly captured Larry and Oz, listen as the Master explains his plans: he is pushing aside the anarchic tradition of hunting and killing, and introducing mass production. He orders one of the prisoners, a member of Harmony's gang, placed on the machine in front of him. She struggles, and the vampires stun her into paralysis. Still live, she is moved along the conveyor as several metal arms are forced into her body, draining her blood.",
                "At his apartment, Giles is in the middle of summoning Anyanka. His ritual is successful, and Anyanka appears, upset that a man summoned her. As the Master finishes his speech, Buffy and Angel arrive. She points a crossbow at the Master and fires, but he spots her and uses Xander as a shield, the arrow hitting him in the shoulder. All hell then breaks loose as Angel releases the prisoners. They all scatter, except for a few, including Larry and Oz, that stay to fight the vampires.",
                "Giles asks what Cordelia wished for, and Anyanka just gloats that she had no idea the wish would create such an exciting world. She advances on him, but Giles isn't afraid as Anyanka's power lies solely in the wishing. Anyanka grabs him by the neck and lifts him off the ground, telling him that she is the wishing. As Buffy fights the numerous vampires, Xander attempts to attack from behind. Angel spots this and saves her, though he is staked in the process. He says Buffy's name just as he turns to dust. Buffy continues the assault.",
                "Anyanka tells Giles that the world they live in now is the only world there is and there's no going back. In the plant, the fight continues. Buffy stakes Xander, as Oz pushes Willow back onto a broken slat of the wooden cage, killing her. The Master moves to fight Buffy personally.",
                "Giles spots Anyanka's necklace, identical to the one Cordelia was wearing, glowing. He rips it off her. Buffy fights the Master, but she is overtaken and he is able to snap her neck.",
                "Giles grabs a blunt object from his desk and prepares to destroy the necklace. Anyanka tells Giles he has no way of knowing if the other world is truly better. Giles, knowing the other world couldn't be any worse than this one, doesn't hesitate and smashes it. Buffy's body drops to the floor as the wish reverses.",
                "Everything reverses to the exact moment Cordelia wishes that Buffy hadn't moved there, though the former doesn't remember anything. Anya attempts to grant the wish, but nothing happens. Cordelia, enjoying the idea of wishing for stuff, starts to wish horrible things on her former friends and men in general. Anya follows, unsuccessful in granting any wishes, as Buffy, Willow, and Xander sit nearby, talking and laughing."

                "With the necklace in hands, Giles finds references to a demon named Anyanka, the patron saint of scorned women. Larry asks what she does, and Giles explains that Anyanka grants wishes. He then remembers Cordelia saying that the world was meant to be different. He sends Oz and Larry home as he prepares to look through more research materials. Driving back to his apartment, Giles spots vampires herding several people into a truck. He attacks and frees the citizens but cannot fight off the vampires. As he lies on the ground, he suddenly hears a scuffle and the vampires are slain. Looking up, he sees a battle-hardened girl, who confirms that she is Buffy Summers and asks him what she's doing there.",
                "Taking Buffy to his house, Giles explains that Anyanka's power lies in her power center and, if it is destroyed, all the wishes she's ever granted will be reversed. Buffy is uninterested and simply asks how to kill her, but Giles explains that it isn't necessary. Giles tells her that the Master is the supreme vampire in the town and is planning something for that evening. The Slayer immediately sets out to kill him. Giles tells her she'll need a plan, but she isn't interested and demands to know where the Master lives. Buffy goes to the Bronze to find it completely deserted. Heading into the basement, she finds Angel cowering in the cage. He recognizes her and tells her that he waited for her but she never came. When the Master rose from the Hellmouth, Angel was imprisoned. He asks to be released so he can help her, and Buffy, tired of being regarded as Sunnydale's savior, moves to free him. However, when Angel recoils from her cross pendant, Buffy realizes he's a vampire. She balks at the idea of releasing him, thinking he's leading her into a trap. Angel shows her his scars, explaining that if nothing else is true: he wants the Master dead.",
                "At the plant, the Master gives a speech in front of an assembled throng of vampires as Willow and Xander stand at his side. In a nearby holding area, human prisoners, including the newly captured Larry and Oz, listen as the Master explains his plans: he is pushing aside the anarchic tradition of hunting and killing, and introducing mass production. He orders one of the prisoners, a member of Harmony's gang, placed on the machine in front of him. She struggles, and the vampires stun her into paralysis. Still live, she is moved along the conveyor as several metal arms are forced into her body, draining her blood.",
                "At his apartment, Giles is in the middle of summoning Anyanka. His ritual is successful, and Anyanka appears, upset that a man summoned her. As the Master finishes his speech, Buffy and Angel arrive. She points a crossbow at the Master and fires, but he spots her and uses Xander as a shield, the arrow hitting him in the shoulder. All hell then breaks loose as Angel releases the prisoners. They all scatter, except for a few, including Larry and Oz, that stay to fight the vampires.",
                "Giles asks what Cordelia wished for, and Anyanka just gloats that she had no idea the wish would create such an exciting world. She advances on him, but Giles isn't afraid as Anyanka's power lies solely in the wishing. Anyanka grabs him by the neck and lifts him off the ground, telling him that she is the wishing. As Buffy fights the numerous vampires, Xander attempts to attack from behind. Angel spots this and saves her, though he is staked in the process. He says Buffy's name just as he turns to dust. Buffy continues the assault.",
                "Anyanka tells Giles that the world they live in now is the only world there is and there's no going back. In the plant, the fight continues. Buffy stakes Xander, as Oz pushes Willow back onto a broken slat of the wooden cage, killing her. The Master moves to fight Buffy personally.",
                "Giles spots Anyanka's necklace, identical to the one Cordelia was wearing, glowing. He rips it off her. Buffy fights the Master, but she is overtaken and he is able to snap her neck.",
                "Giles grabs a blunt object from his desk and prepares to destroy the necklace. Anyanka tells Giles he has no way of knowing if the other world is truly better. Giles, knowing the other world couldn't be any worse than this one, doesn't hesitate and smashes it. Buffy's body drops to the floor as the wish reverses.",
                "Everything reverses to the exact moment Cordelia wishes that Buffy hadn't moved there, though the former doesn't remember anything. Anya attempts to grant the wish, but nothing happens. Cordelia, enjoying the idea of wishing for stuff, starts to wish horrible things on her former friends and men in general. Anya follows, unsuccessful in granting any wishes, as Buffy, Willow, and Xander sit nearby, talking and laughing."

                "The next day, the Scoobies are sitting on a bench and discussing the previous night's battle. They're all bruised and cut up, Buffy is wearing a sling on her arm and Giles has a cast on his left wrist. They mention that Angel was knocked out during the fight and Buffy feared he was dead. When Xander stops by, Willow comments that he should be glad he wasn't at school last night. He offers the group a snack, and Oz, feeling \"strangely full,\" declines. As Xander walks away, he runs into Cordelia, who taunts him again. He smiles and continues past his now-confused ex-girlfriend."

The two girls chant and cast the spell. However, Willow is given psychic flashes of the alternate world and causes sand to spill on her hands. As the spell ends, the alternate vampire Willow vanishes before Oz is able to stake her.

At home, while trying to comfort Buffy, Joyce inadvertently lets slip through her thoughts that she and Giles had sex on the hood of a police car under the influence of the band candy. Twice.",

They make little progress with their research and every likely suspects are crossed out, except for Freddy, who Oz can't seem to find.

Angel hunts down the demon at the cemetery, and successfully acquires the heart.",

Buffy civilly talks to him, telling him that the reason everybody ignores him is that they have their own problems to deal with.

The next day at the library, the Scooby Gang gather for another group meeting, where they find that Giles is making little to no progress with the Mayor and has no clue what the Ascension is. Wesley soon arrives, promising new updates, but his information is exactly the same as Giles'.",

Willow suggests that Buffy talk to Angel and straighten things out. Percy arrives, telling Willow that they'll have to reschedule their planned study session. Willow then talks to Buffy about the basketball game held after school later that day. Apparently, everyone except for Buffy is going.",
                "Buffy is bothered by persistent itching on her hand, and decides to talk to Giles. After a little research, he tells her that the demon's blood might have infected her with an \"aspect of the demon.\" Later that day, Xander, Willow, Oz, and an absent-minded Buffy watch a pep rally, where Willow catches Buffy feeling her head for horns. Willow further horrifies her by wondering if the demon is male. That night, Buffy meets Angel during her usual patrol and tells him about the demon. Angel tells her that he'll still love her no matter what she looks like, though his exact wording only freaks her out even more.",

When Cordelia passes by, Buffy hears Xander wondering if she and Wesley had ever kissed before. She responds to him, aloud, and he remarks that \"[Buffy] read [his] mind.\" Buffy then walks through the school halls, where she finally realizes she's hearing people's thoughts. Freaked out, she talks to Giles about her new ability, and he realizes the mouth-less demons are telepathic. Buffy seems overjoyed about it, and Giles says that this power may be very useful in combat.",

During a class on literature, she answers the teacher's questions with no difficulty, impressing the rest of the students and especially the teacher. Buffy then hears the thoughts of Freddy Iverson, who writes editorials for the school newspaper, and has a seriously negative opinion about everything and everybody at Sunnydale High School.",

Angel realizes what she is trying to do and tells her she won't be able to read his thoughts. He reassures her that what happened with Faith meant nothing and that in 243 years, he's only ever loved Buffy.",
                "The gang meets up at the library again the next morning, where Buffy tells her friends about her new power. She finds Xander constantly thinking about sex, and Wesley keeps thinking about Cordelia. Oz thinks extremely deep thoughts, while Willow is upset because Buffy has access to Oz's mind and will learn more about him than she ever will. While in the school cafeteria, Buffy's telepathy starts to become painful, as the voices become too much for her to endure. Out of nowhere, a single, menacing voice stands out among the pandemonium: \"This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all.\" Buffy passes out, overwhelmed by the cacophony of others' thoughts.",

Giles tries to find a cure for Buffy, but before she leaves to rest at home, she hears the painful truth: she'll go insane if the telepathy continues. At home, while trying to comfort Buffy, Joyce inadvertently lets slip through her thoughts that she and Giles had sex on the hood of a police car under the influence of the band candy. Twice.",
                "Meanwhile, the rest of the gang starts interrogating members of the faculty and the students. They make little progress with their research and every likely suspects are crossed out, except for Freddy, who Oz can't seem to find. In the meantime, Giles and Wesley had come across a potential cure for Buffy's telepathic abilities, though it requires the heart of the second remaining demon. Angel hunts down the demon at the cemetery, and successfully acquires the heart.",

He tells Angel and Buffy that the same thing will happen to them, as Buffy will continue to age while Angel stays the same. He also points out that they also have to deal with the fact that there is a constant danger of him losing his soul if he feels a moment of happiness.

A sorcerer became the embodiment of the demon Lohesh a four-winged soul killer, and decimated an entire village within hours; only a few people escaped. Anya explains that an Ascension means that a human being becomes pure demon. She tells them that all the demons that walk the earth are tainted \u2014 human hybrids like vampires, but that a pure demon is different.

                "Both Slayers are more than a little shocked. \"You did it,\" says Faith to a horrified Buffy, before delivering a backhanded punch to Buffy's face \u2014 knocking her backwards to land on her back, caught off guard. \"You killed me,\" Faith goes on. Then, noticing an approaching flatbed semi-truck, Faith steps onto the ledge and continues, \"Still won't help your boy, though. You should've been there, B. Quite a ride.\" Faith then falls back off the roof and into the passing truck, crashing roughly into the debris.",
                "Buffy rushes to the ledge and watches as her fellow Slayer's limp body, along with the blood she needs to cure Angel, is carried away on the truck."

The phone rings and Buffy answers, but\u00a0the caller\u00a0hangs up.",
                "When Buffy returns to her dorm room, she finds all of her belongings missing and a note similar to that found in Eddie's room. She goes to the Bronze\u00a0and she thinks she sees\u00a0Angel from afar,\u00a0but it turns out to just be a guy who looks like him. As she mopes, Xander suddenly appears behind her, having returned from his trip a couple of days earlier. He reveals that his car broke down in Oxnard and his tour of America didn't happen, but instead he spent a month and a half washing dishes at Ladies Night club earning money for repairs (which mercifully came to an end when a male stripper fell ill, although Xander refuses to elaborate further). Xander also says that he now lives in his parents' basement and has to pay rent. Buffy tells Xander about Sunday, explaining that she doesn't want to intrude on Willow and Oz's first days in college by involving them. She then admits that she doesn't think she'll be able to handle the new environment. Xander tells Buffy that in the darkest times of his life he would get through it by thinking about what she would do and that she's his hero. Xander pledges his full support in stopping Sunday.",
                "The two research and find that the student disappearances started at the same time that a fraternity lost its charter, its house lying empty while zoning issues dragged on. Heading there, the two spy on the vampire group through the skylight as they root through and laugh at Buffy's possessions. Xander decides to round up the rest of the gang while Buffy remains behind to keep watch, only for the skylight to give way from under her, landing her right in front of Sunday and the other vampires.",
                "In Buffy's dorm room, Willow assures Kathy that Buffy isn't the kind to run away\u2026 except for the time when she did. Xander turns up and, after a happy reunion with his friends, gets them to come with him to help. Meanwhile, Buffy is being kicked around by Sunday; when she sees the vampire break the Class Protector Award she was given at her senior prom, Buffy is angered enough to regain her confidence and soundly trounces the vampires. She is helped when Willow, Xander and Oz turn up. Although a couple of the vamps escape, Buffy manages to take out Sunday with a backhand throw of a broken tennis racket. Later, the gang recovers Buffy's things from the lair when Giles approaches laden with weapons. He apologizes to Buffy for turning her away and is ready to fight the evil. Instead, he's just asked to help carry the boxes. Buffy realizes that college is actually turning out to be like high school, so she at least knows what to expect.",
                "Tom, one of the only surviving vampires from Sunday's lair, runs away from the scene. He is suddenly stunned with a taser, then three masked men armed and dressed in camouflage fatigues approach the fallen vampire."

Before Buffy leaves, Kathy informs her that she has devised a system to keep track of calls so that they can be properly billed.

Buffy's atypical interest in what Giles has planned for the day arouses his suspicion, and, when pressed, she admits she is avoiding her dorm room until Kathy leaves for classes. Meanwhile, Kathy is in the dorm room scrubbing the grass stain on her sweater. She spies Buffy's closet and takes a look inside. She finds a sweater that she likes and removes it from the closet.

Buffy is annoyed when Kathy \u2014 wearing Buffy's sweater \u2014 invites herself to their table. Kathy remarks that since Buffy ruined her sweater, she didn't think that she would mind.

Mok'tagar can recognize their own kind by the lack of a soul.",

Spike insults her and says that the gem is all that matters for now. When he finally breaks into the crypt, Harmony tags along. Spike tells her to take anything else she wants, and he looks for the Gem of Amara. Seeing an elaborate pendant, he puts it on and picks up a cross, but it burns him as it normally would. Harmony continues to talk, and Spike loses his patience and stakes her. However, nothing happens to Harmony and the wound instantly heals itself.

Buffy asks if she did something wrong, but Parker assures her she didn't and he had a lot of fun. Buffy realizes that, while their night together meant a lot to her, for him it was nothing more than casual sex.

Xander shows up, but Spike quickly knocks him out of the way and continues to beat up Buffy. As he does, he notes that Buffy and Parker didn't seem to know each other that well and that she fell for his trick of playing a sensitive side and getting her to sleep with him. He then mocks her by telling her that she must not be worth a second go, and jokes that Angel told him as much. Enraged, Buffy pummels Spike and takes the ring from him. Smoking from exposure to the sun, he dives down into the sewers.",

Spike isn't keen, since killing Buffy's best friend would set her on to them. Harmony then complains that she wants to go out, and, after charming Spike, he agrees to take her to a party.",
                "Buffy and Parker arrive at the college party, and they run into Spike and Harmony carrying a bitten man. Amused, Buffy teases Spike about being with Harmony, and the two vampires flee. Buffy pursues them and, outside, she and Spike fight. Harmony interrupts revealing that Drusilla left Spike for a fungus demon and that they'll be back as soon as they get the Gem of Amara. Irritated, Spike takes Harmony, and they leave.",
                "Anya shows up at Xander's place. He gets her a drink, and he turns around to see that she's naked.",
                "Buffy calls Giles and informs him about Spike and Harmony. Giles tells Buffy that the Gem of Amara was rumored to contain great power if a vampire was ever to get a hold of it, but it was concluded to have never existed when they scoured the Earth looking for it and found nothing. Giles decides to research it in case, and Buffy says she's going to sleep.",
                "In Harmony and Spike's lair, Spike is trying to read blueprints of the underground tunnels while Harmony is laying on the bed. Harmony drones on questioning him about relatively unimportant things, irritating him. Harmony, however, starts flirting with him, and Spike joins her on the bed.",
                "Xander is shocked that Anya is standing in front of him naked, as she explains that having sex is the best way for her to rid herself of her feelings for him. Xander attempts to refuse, telling her that having sex is supposed to be about more than that, but he gives in to the offer.",
                "Buffy returns to the party and finds Parker. They discuss Parker's decision to take History, and he speaks about making choices. Buffy finds herself enraptured with Parker's deep thoughts and, afterwards, decides to make her own choice and have sex with him.",
                "The next morning, Buffy wakes up to an empty bed. As she's searching for her clothes, Parker arrives with coffee. He says that he'll call her.",
                "While dressing their clothes, Anya tells Xander that she's over him. When he says he's okay with that, she storms out in anger.",
                "Spike wakes up to Harmony drawing on his back with lipstick. He gets up to go back to work, and she complains he loves the tunnel more than her. He says he love syphilis more than her.",
                "Buffy arrives in her dorm room, where she's surprised to find Willow and Giles. They tell her that an ancient text was found that places the Gem of Amara in Sunnydale. After they get rid of Giles, Buffy tells Willow about her night with Parker. She then waits for Parker to call her all day, but he never does.",
                "Below ground, as Spike starts breaking into the crypt, Harmony balks when she's told she can't go back outside and complains. Spike insults her and says that the gem is all that matters for now. When he finally breaks into the crypt, Harmony tags along. Spike tells her to take anything else she wants, and he looks for the Gem of Amara. Seeing an elaborate pendant, he puts it on and picks up a cross, but it burns him as it normally would. Harmony continues to talk, and Spike loses his patience and stakes her. However, nothing happens to Harmony and the wound instantly heals itself. Spike realizes the ring Harmony picked up is the Gem of Amara. Upset, Harmony throws it at him. Spike leaves the crypt wearing the ring.",
                "At Giles' place, while they search for answers, Xander finds a TV and turns it on. They watch the news and see that there was a sinkhole caused by the erosion of dirt beneath it. They come to the conclusion that it was Spike's underground digging that caused it. Giles sends Xander to find Buffy while the others will head to the sinkhole. As Xander looks for Buffy, he runs into Anya who tries to talk to him about the previous evening and her feelings, but he's distracted and blows her off. In the crypt, Giles, Willow, and Oz confront a crying Harmony, and she confirms Spike has the ring.",
                "Buffy tracks down Parker, but she finds him putting the same moves he used on her on another girl. She asks him if everything is okay, and Parker tells her it is. She asks if he wants to do something, but Parker refuses, citing earlier plans, and attempts to rush off. Buffy asks if she did something wrong, but Parker assures her she didn't and he had a lot of fun. Buffy realizes that, while their night together meant a lot to her, for him it was nothing more than casual sex. He reminds her that it was her that put the moves on him and claims that he thought they were on the same level. He then quickly leaves, casually telling Buffy that he'll call her. As Buffy reels, she turns around and Spike hits her.",
                "Buffy and Spike fight as he enjoys the non-lethal sunlight. She stakes him, and he reveals the ring that is protecting him. Xander shows up, but Spike quickly knocks him out of the way and continues to beat up Buffy. As he does, he notes that Buffy and Parker didn't seem to know each other that well and that she fell for his trick of playing a sensitive side and getting her to sleep with him. He then mocks her by telling her that she must not be worth a second go, and jokes that Angel told him as much. Enraged, Buffy pummels Spike and takes the ring from him. Smoking from exposure to the sun, he dives down into the sewers.",
                "Later, Buffy and the gang sit around at Giles' place and Buffy decides that she wants Angel to have the ring. Oz volunteers to take it when he goes to Los Angeles for a gig.",
                "That night, Buffy talks to Willow about what happened with Parker, wondering if every guy she sleeps with will end up evil the next morning. Willow assures her that she just made a mistake. Despite how badly he's treated her, Buffy is still hung up on him and wonders if it was something about her that put him off. Willow insists it isn't. Buffy decides to take a walk and parts from Willow. Separately, Buffy, Anya, and Harmony walk around the UC Sunnydale campus."

Willow follows and tells her to get over it and have fun at the party that night; however, Buffy thinks that Giles will want her to do some patrolling. Much to Buffy's surprise, however, when she goes to visit Giles, he's wearing a sombrero and is in a cheerful Halloween mood. Reminding her that demons are generally quiescent on Halloween, he encourages her to go to the party and have fun.",

He agrees that they're somewhat dating and invites her to the Halloween party that night, telling her to dress in something scary. Buffy visits Professor Walsh and asks for her missed assignments, but she is met with less than kind reception from the strict teacher. Riley, however, gives her the assignment. When she says she'll get them done that night, he tells her that, since it's Halloween, she should go out and have fun instead. He tells her that Halloween is the night when all the monsters come out, and she replies that's a misnomer.",

Xander asks what the symbol represents, and the guy says he doesn't know: it's just supposed to be scary. Oz, listening to the speakers, says the left one is crackling. He goes to strip the wire a little bit and cuts his hand. While he walks by to go out and clean it, some of his blood spills onto the symbol, making it pulse and waver ominously.

When Joyce talks about how Hank used to love going trick or treating with her, Buffy comments that he's not interested in her anymore. Joyce tells her that their divorce really did have nothing to do with Buffy. Buffy acknowledges that she knows that's true, but she wishes he still took an interest in her now.",
                "At the party, a guy leads a blindfolded girl to stick her hand into a bowl of grapes and tells her the grapes inside are eyeballs. When she takes the blindfold off, they really are eyeballs. She screams and pandemonium takes control over everyone around them.",

Buffy points our that if that happens he'd probably just turn into cool head waiter guy instead. He says, as long as he's cool and has some kind of power, he'll be happy. Willow and Oz show up. Willow, who's dressed as Joan of Arc, states that they have a lot in common since she was almost burned at the stake and had a close relationship with God. When Xander asks who Oz is, he pulls his shirt aside to show his sticker name tag that says \"Hello, My Name Is\" with the word \"GOD\" written under it.

Several people try to escape only for the door to slam before they can get out.

Willow gets caught in some cobwebs and wigs out. Xander is standing in the hallway when a plastic skeleton with a knife pops out. They're all pretty standard Halloween obstacles until Oz turns around and sees a tarantula on Willow's shoulder. He goes over and knocks it off quickly, but Willow is still creeped out. Buffy says they should just get to the party part of the party. While walking down the next hallway, they get confused because it's not leading to where it should. Buffy finds real blood on the carpet, to which Xander replies the frat boys have gone overboard. Buffy shushes him because she hears a squeaking and, when they look up, dozens of real bats attack them. However, as soon as they stop, Oz finds one of them and it's only rubber.

As she walks around to the front, she sees a girl screaming at a window, and the window bricks over on its own. Inside, and unable to get out of the house, Buffy tells the gang to find a way out and to get help. They find Chaz, one of the fraternity members, in a closet saying that \"it's alive.\" A skeleton attacks Buffy from behind with a knife, but she destroys it and it becomes fake again. Chaz goes back to the closet, and when they turn to look, the closet is now gone. Anya goes to Giles for help, saying they need to save Xander.

Willow and Oz, who go off on their own to find a way out, find a set of stairs and head up.

Xander approaches a mirror, and along, with his reflection, a once-fake head on the table behind him says that he can see him too.

He practices holding out a lighter to light a phantom cigarette and asking them about their day. Buffy tells him that bartending is more than just lighting cigarettes and talking to girls; he has to actually mix drinks. Xander says he's fine since he's seen the movie Cocktail. He asks the girls if they're going to stop by that night. Willow has a date with Oz at the Bronze, while Buffy answers she might.",

When she enters her dorm, she sees Buffy watching TV up close and talking about how pretty the colors are. Willow assumes that she slept with Parker again, but Buffy tells her that there were four guys, shocking Willow. Buffy starts to explain and Willow understands that Buffy just meant that she was drinking beer with four guys, not that she slept with all of them. Willow, saying that Buffy shouldn't be drowning her sorrows in alcohol, says Parker deserves to be killed by spider bites. Buffy agrees and starts to leave, but Willow stops her and tells her she needs to get dressed first. Confused, Buffy looks down and realizes she's still in her pajamas.",

Professor Walsh calls on her and she blurts out that Willow has already done the reading. Willow and the rest of the class look at Buffy strangely. Professor Walsh says that, because of that, Willow will have some time on her hands. Buffy sees a girl in front of her eating a sandwich; she then grabs it from the girl and starts eating it.

Meanwhile, a pretty girl is at the bar under the circumstances Xander's been practicing for, but he isn't paying attention because he's too busy watching Buffy.

She tells him that \"beer good,\" but Xander tells her \"beer bad\" and pushes her out the door, telling her to go home. Her four drinking buddies realize she's gone and ask: \"where girl?\" but continue drinking. One of them leaves to go to the bathroom and soon emerges as a violent cavemen. He rushes at Xander and knocks him out. Xander wakes up to the caveman leaning over him and the other three students cowering on the other side of the room. The caveman yells and the other three are overcome with violent convulsions. Backs hunch over, brows thicken, arms grow longer and more muscular, voices deepen, and hair becomes long all over their bodies.

Oz wakes up the next morning to see that the other werewolf is Veruca. They sneak into the campus laundry room for clothes and Veruca appeals to the animal within him. Willow shows up at Oz's and instead of being welcomed with opened arms, Oz is closed off and so she leaves. Buffy informs Giles of the two werewolves being spotted on campus and later goes to Oz in the crypt. She finds him welding the door and asks if he got out, then mentions another werewolf. He tells her he did, but he says he doesn't remember anything about what happened when he got out.",

Buffy goes to Giles, fearing that the world is going to come to an end, but he dismisses her ideas telling her that earthquakes are a normal Southern California occurrence. He then changes the subject to tracking down the commandos, telling Buffy that based on their information it seems that the base is below UC Sunnydale and that other students may be involved. Buffy gets uncomfortable with the topic and tries to discuss the earthquake more, but Giles once again shrugs off her concerns.",
                "In the Initiative facilities, Riley asks Forrest what he knows about the Slayer, which Forrest thinks is just a myth that monsters made up. In fact, the demons themselves are explained away as being simple animals. A demon goes berserk and attacks Riley and Forrest. They manage to subdue it and wonder at the strange activity their demonic captives have been exhibiting since the earthquake.",

Meanwhile, a guy mixing drinks alone in one of the dorm rooms has his throat slit by a large demon. Later, Willow overhears a conversation between Percy and Laurie where Percy calls Willow \"captain of the nerd squad\" to soothe his girl's jealousy. Depressed, Willow goes into one of the dorm rooms to lie on a bed. When the lights come back on, she finds herself next to a body, a symbol carved onto the chest of a pyramid with an eye in the center.",

Buffy mentions she knows the symbol from somewhere, but she can't remember where. She goes to hunt down the demon and recognizes the symbol on a crypt. Inside, the demon is collecting the bones of a small child. She fights the demon, but it escapes, and she runs into Riley. He tries to talk to her and convince her to give a relationship between them a chance, but, because of all the pain in her past and the problems she's certain it would cause, she tells him no. She explains that she went to high school on top of a Hellmouth for three years and he has no idea what he's doing, so he'll, more than likely, just end up dead. He tries to convince her that he past relationships weren't with him, and it'll be different because of that fact, but she still says she can't be in another doomed relationship.",
                "Research leads the Scoobies to find that the demon needs the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and the Word of Valios to perform a ritual called the Sacrifice of Three, which will destroy the world. Willow and Xander head out to go to a museum to see if they can find the Word, but Xander says he needs to stop by his place to pick up his weapons.",

When Willow and Xander walk in, Spike falls and destroys the table, completely missing the stake. Xander tells Spike that he should've just asked him to stake him, because he's more than happy to help him out. Willow grabs the stake away from Xander, and Spike appeals to her by pointing out that he's not even scary anymore. Willow argues that they know Spike now and letting him kill himself wouldn't be right. After getting his weapons, Xander tells Spike that, if he does any more damage, he'll be sleeping in the garage. Pitying him, Willow insists that they take him along. Spike tries to get them to leave without him by promising Willow he won't hurt himself, but Willow insists he come. Xander tells him to look on the bright side: if they can't find what they're looking for, then Spike can die when the apocalypse happens.",
                "Out on patrol, Buffy runs into Riley again, and Riley resumes their conversation. He tells Buffy that she needs to be more positive, to not look for the bad in the situation. When a few people walk by, Riley says it makes sense for them to be together because both of them are \"fry cooks.\" She points out to him there's a big difference because he's an amateur \"fry cook\" and she comes from a long line of \"fry cooks\" that tend to die before they reach the age of twenty-five. Riley says that he knows the risks of what they do and he still wants to take a chance with them because the work they do is rewarding and even fun. Buffy tells him that the last person she knew that thought it was fun is in a coma. Riley says that he knows part of her reluctance is because of someone in her past, and Buffy just tells him to leave her alone.",
                "Outside the Historical Museum Sunnydale, Willow and Xander are unsuccessful in their search for the Word of Valios. Spike discourage them talking about Xander's lack of direction in his life and Willow's inability to get Oz to stay, as well as their seeming uselessness to Buffy. Spike says that they are merely slayer \"groupies\" whom Buffy doesn't have the heart to turn away; Buffy would be a much better Slayer without constantly having to watch out for them. Willow and Xander protest his words as being untrue and claim he's just saying this stuff to make them stake him. Spike argues that he simply doesn't want sympathy from two people he thinks are more useless than him. Spike turns and walks away, grinning.",
                "Giles comes across an illustration of the Word of Valios and sees that it is actually a talisman, and he realizes that he has it. After fishing it out of his weapons trunk, he grabs his coat and is about to leave when the demons reveal themselves in his living room. Giles tries to fight them off, but they beat him badly. The gang find Giles bruised, and he tells them he bought the talisman at a sorcerers estate sale and thought it was a knock off. Giles sends them off to the Sunnydale High School after he informs them that the ritual is to open the Hellmouth.",
                "Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Spike head back to\u00a0the ruins of the school. Buffy tells them to be careful, and Spike says he'd be happy if they all just fell in and got swallowed up. When Buffy asks why Spike is even there, Willow explains that he'll stake himself if they leave him alone. Buffy asks why that's a problem, then says never mind. After walking through the black corridors\u00a0(and stepping around piles of charred \"Mayor meat\"), the gang makes it to the crater that used to be the school library, where three demons are performing the ritual.",
                "A fight breaks out, and Xander runs to grab the blood whilst Willow gets the bag with the child bones in it. The first demon grabs the blood back from Xander then throws himself into the Hellmouth, revealing that the demons themselves are the sacrifice for the ritual. Willow throws the bag of bones at Xander, who is just about to be attacked by a demon so he throws it back at her. When a demon then comes after her she throws the bag to Spike.",
                "When the demon attacks Spike to get the bones, he punches Spike a few times and after several hits, he hits the demon back. When there's no pain in his head, he realizes he can hurt demons. Ecstatic over this revelation, Spike promptly beats the demon senseless. Caught up in the excitement of being able to fight, he forgets about the fact that they're trying to stop the sacrifices, and throws the demon, who just happened to grab the bag of bones when he was on the floor, into the Hellmouth. When Willow and Xander look at him aggravatingly, he asks why they're so upset because he believes he was helping.",
                "Debris starts falling, and Buffy yells for them to get out because the building is gonna come down. Spike gets knocked out by falling debris whilst Willow and Xander (who stops to help grab Spike) take off. While the rest of the gang escape the soon-to-be-falling building, Riley shows up to help Buffy fight. The third demon grabs the talisman and crawls its way into the Hellmouth, and Buffy goes in after it. Thanks to a cable and hook Riley attached to her belt, Buffy is pulled out of the Hellmouth along with the third demon. The earthquake stops.",
                "Afterwards, when Riley and Buffy come across Xander, Willow, and Spike, he tries to keep up his secret identity by saying he was walking by and heard noises. Willow asks why he's wearing military gear. Riley tries to say he was playing paintball, but Xander outright says Riley is one of the commandos.

As much as Riley wants to tell Buffy who he really is, he can't, but Buffy is able to guess based on the evidence of the past several weeks. Riley is amazed by her talents and abilities, but, when she confesses that she's the Slayer, he doesn't know what that is. An earthquake hits; though mild, the memory of the last earthquake Buffy experienced disturbs her.",

Buffy goes to Giles, fearing that the world is going to come to an end, but he dismisses her ideas telling her that earthquakes are a normal Southern California occurrence. He then changes the subject to tracking down the commandos, telling Buffy that based on their information it seems that the base is below UC Sunnydale and that other students may be involved. Buffy gets uncomfortable with the topic and tries to discuss the earthquake more, but Giles once again shrugs off her concerns.",
                "In the Initiative facilities, Riley asks Forrest what he knows about the Slayer, which Forrest thinks is just a myth that monsters made up. In fact, the demons themselves are explained away as being simple animals. A demon goes berserk and attacks Riley and Forrest. They manage to subdue it and wonder at the strange activity their demonic captives have been exhibiting since the earthquake.",
                "At the party, Willow sees Percy, whom she tutored in high school. The girl he is with, Laurie, has a problem with Willow talking to Percy and suggests that they go somewhere else. Meanwhile, a guy mixing drinks alone in one of the dorm rooms has his throat slit by a large demon. Later, Willow overhears a conversation between Percy and Laurie where Percy calls Willow \"captain of the nerd squad\" to soothe his girl's jealousy. Depressed, Willow goes into one of the dorm rooms to lie on a bed. When the lights come back on, she finds herself next to a body, a symbol carved onto the chest of a pyramid with an eye in the center.",

Buffy mentions she knows the symbol from somewhere, but she can't remember where. She goes to hunt down the demon and recognizes the symbol on a crypt. Inside, the demon is collecting the bones of a small child. She fights the demon, but it escapes, and she runs into Riley. He tries to talk to her and convince her to give a relationship between them a chance, but, because of all the pain in her past and the problems she's certain it would cause, she tells him no. She explains that she went to high school on top of a Hellmouth for three years and he has no idea what he's doing, so he'll, more than likely, just end up dead. He tries to convince her that he past relationships weren't with him, and it'll be different because of that fact, but she still says she can't be in another doomed relationship.",
                "Research leads the Scoobies to find that the demon needs the blood of a man, the bones of a child, and the Word of Valios to perform a ritual called the Sacrifice of Three, which will destroy the world.

When Willow and Xander walk in, Spike falls and destroys the table, completely missing the stake. Xander tells Spike that he should've just asked him to stake him, because he's more than happy to help him out. Willow grabs the stake away from Xander, and Spike appeals to her by pointing out that he's not even scary anymore. Willow argues that they know Spike now and letting him kill himself wouldn't be right. After getting his weapons, Xander tells Spike that, if he does any more damage, he'll be sleeping in the garage. Pitying him, Willow insists that they take him along. Spike tries to get them to leave without him by promising Willow he won't hurt himself, but Willow insists he come. Xander tells him to look on the bright side: if they can't find what they're looking for, then Spike can die when the apocalypse happens.",
                "Out on patrol, Buffy runs into Riley again, and Riley resumes their conversation. He tells Buffy that she needs to be more positive, to not look for the bad in the situation. When a few people walk by, Riley says it makes sense for them to be together because both of them are \"fry cooks.\" She points out to him there's a big difference because he's an amateur \"fry cook\" and she comes from a long line of \"fry cooks\" that tend to die before they reach the age of twenty-five. Riley says that he knows the risks of what they do and he still wants to take a chance with them because the work they do is rewarding and even fun. Buffy tells him that the last person she knew that thought it was fun is in a coma. Riley says that he knows part of her reluctance is because of someone in her past, and Buffy just tells him to leave her alone.",
                "Outside the Historical Museum Sunnydale, Willow and Xander are unsuccessful in their search for the Word of Valios. Spike discourage them talking about Xander's lack of direction in his life and Willow's inability to get Oz to stay, as well as their seeming uselessness to Buffy. Spike says that they are merely slayer \"groupies\" whom Buffy doesn't have the heart to turn away; Buffy would be a much better Slayer without constantly having to watch out for them. Willow and Xander protest his words as being untrue and claim he's just saying this stuff to make them stake him. Spike argues that he simply doesn't want sympathy from two people he thinks are more useless than him. Spike turns and walks away, grinning.",

After fishing it out of his weapons trunk, he grabs his coat and is about to leave when the demons reveal themselves in his living room. Giles tries to fight them off, but they beat him badly. The gang find Giles bruised, and he tells them he bought the talisman at a sorcerers estate sale and thought it was a knock off. Giles sends them off to the Sunnydale High School after he informs them that the ritual is to open the Hellmouth.",
                "Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Spike head back to\u00a0the ruins of the school. Buffy tells them to be careful, and Spike says he'd be happy if they all just fell in and got swallowed up. When Buffy asks why Spike is even there, Willow explains that he'll stake himself if they leave him alone. Buffy asks why that's a problem, then says never mind. After walking through the black corridors\u00a0(and stepping around piles of charred \"Mayor meat\"), the gang makes it to the crater that used to be the school library, where three demons are performing the ritual.",
                "A fight breaks out, and Xander runs to grab the blood whilst Willow gets the bag with the child bones in it. The first demon grabs the blood back from Xander then throws himself into the Hellmouth, revealing that the demons themselves are the sacrifice for the ritual. Willow throws the bag of bones at Xander, who is just about to be attacked by a demon so he throws it back at her. When a demon then comes after her she throws the bag to Spike.",
                "When the demon attacks Spike to get the bones, he punches Spike a few times and after several hits, he hits the demon back. When there's no pain in his head, he realizes he can hurt demons. Ecstatic over this revelation, Spike promptly beats the demon senseless. Caught up in the excitement of being able to fight, he forgets about the fact that they're trying to stop the sacrifices, and throws the demon, who just happened to grab the bag of bones when he was on the floor, into the Hellmouth. When Willow and Xander look at him aggravatingly, he asks why they're so upset because he believes he was helping.",
                "Debris starts falling, and Buffy yells for them to get out because the building is gonna come down. Spike gets knocked out by falling debris whilst Willow and Xander (who stops to help grab Spike) take off. While the rest of the gang escape the soon-to-be-falling building, Riley shows up to help Buffy fight. The third demon grabs the talisman and crawls its way into the Hellmouth, and Buffy goes in after it. Thanks to a cable and hook Riley attached to her belt, Buffy is pulled out of the Hellmouth along with the third demon. The earthquake stops.",
                "Afterwards, when Riley and Buffy come across Xander, Willow, and Spike, he tries to keep up his secret identity by saying he was walking by and heard noises. Willow asks why he's wearing military gear. Riley tries to say he was playing paintball, but Xander outright says Riley is one of the commandos.

Led by Professor Walsh, Buffy is given the tour of the facility, and then is basically made a member of their team. Tara tries to give a doll's eye crystal to Willow, but Willow doesn't want to accept, because it is Tara's family heirloom.

Willow is upset saying that she could have invited someone to come as well if she'd known it was an open gathering, but when Buffy asks who she wanted to invite Willow pretends it was hypothetical and doesn't mention Tara. Willow then questions how much trust Buffy should put in the Initiative, reminding her of 314 and that they don't know the organization's ultimate agenda, only for Buffy to rush off with Riley and friends when all of their pagers go off. After being abandoned by Buffy, Willow goes to Tara's dorm room. At a briefing, Professor Walsh and Dr. Angleman explain that they're tracking a Polgara demon and want it bringing in with its arms undamaged.

She is told it will be an easy mission. Wearing a microphone and camera, complete with a heart monitor, Buffy goes on the mission alone, but it turns out to be a trap set by Professor Walsh. Instead of being a small and non-dangerous demon, it turns out to be two very large demons who are both armed, and who Buffy had previously seen imprisoned at the Initiative. Steel doors slam shut, trapping Buffy in a small area of the sewers with the demons. She attempts to use the Initiative weapon that Professor Walsh gave her, but it is defective and doesn't work. Meanwhile, Riley is kept out of the way by being sent out with a team to find and recover Hostile 17.",

Buffy fights and the heart monitor loses her heartbeat when she drops it to the ground. When Riley returns from his mission, Professor Walsh informs him that Buffy is dead, and makes up a story about Buffy going out on her own to attack some demons, despite protests from Maggie. At that point, having killed the two demons, Buffy comes on to the camera feed and informs Walsh that her attempts to kill her failed, promising to show her how powerful a Slayer really is. Riley sees this, and then walks out on Walsh, while she's pleading with him to come back.",

Buffy impresses Professor Walsh as she quickly passes a test of her strengths and fighting talents. Buffy talks about her night but Willow's quiet evening spent with friends doesn't seem to compare. The Scooby Gang has plans that night to meet at the Bronze.",
                "Giles visits Spike at his new crypt and gives Spike the money he's owed for helping him when he was transformed into a Fyarl demon. Spike tries to make it clear that he has no interest in helping them anymore. Riley takes Buffy into the Initiative, which she is incredibly impressed to see. Led by Professor Walsh, Buffy is given the tour of the facility, and then is basically made a member of their team. Tara tries to give a doll's eye crystal to Willow, but Willow doesn't want to accept, because it is Tara's family heirloom. Tara asks if they can perform some spells that night, but Willow has to turn her down due to her plans with the others at the Bronze and also declines to take Tara worried that she might feel out of place. Trying to hide her hurt, Tara hurries away to class. Professor Walsh enters the secure labs and the room 314. After exchanging words with her colleague, Dr. Angleman, Professor Walsh checks up on her special project, a part-demon, part human creature named Adam.",
                "Buffy is an hour late meeting her friends, and when she does show, she brings Riley and other Initiative members. Willow is upset saying that she could have invited someone to come as well if she'd known it was an open gathering, but when Buffy asks who she wanted to invite Willow pretends it was hypothetical and doesn't mention Tara. Willow then questions how much trust Buffy should put in the Initiative, reminding her of 314 and that they don't know the organization's ultimate agenda, only for Buffy to rush off with Riley and friends when all of their pagers go off. After being abandoned by Buffy, Willow goes to Tara's dorm room. At a briefing, Professor Walsh and Dr. Angleman explain that they're tracking a Polgara demon and want it bringing in with its arms undamaged. Walsh is annoyed when Buffy asks questions during the briefing and refuses to wear camouflage. Forrest also finds himself developing a dislike of Buffy's presence in the Initiative, as she takes his spot on Riley's team despite him being placed in charge of his own squad.",
                "Forrest spots \"Hostile 17\" \u2014 Spike \u2014 and sends his team after the vampire. As Spike is running away, they shoot him with a tracer so that they'll be able to keep track of his location. The demon attacks; Buffy and Riley team up and fight it together. Afterward, they go to Riley's dorm room and have sex. Professor Walsh watches from a secret camera hidden in Riley's room.",
                "Desperate, Spike goes to Giles for help and is forced to give up the last of Giles's money in exchange for that help. The next morning, Buffy is surprised to see Riley is still in bed by her side when she wakes. They talk, but when Buffy asks about 314, Riley gets a call from Professor Walsh, requesting his help. Walsh talks with Dr. Angleman and they decide that Buffy is becoming a liability to the Initiative and a distraction for Riley. They decide to eliminate her immediately.",
                "Giles tries to remove the tracer from Spike's shoulder, but it's difficult and they don't have much time. Buffy gets back to her dorm room to find that Willow also stayed out all night. A few seconds later Willow returns, now carrying the crystal she had previously refused to accept from Tara.",
                "Buffy is beeped by the Initiative and is sent on a new mission \u2014 to find a class 3 (not very dangerous) creature and transmit a picture of it to Maggie Walsh. She is told it will be an easy mission. Wearing a microphone and camera, complete with a heart monitor, Buffy goes on the mission alone, but it turns out to be a trap set by Professor Walsh. Instead of being a small and non-dangerous demon, it turns out to be two very large demons who are both armed, and who Buffy had previously seen imprisoned at the Initiative. Steel doors slam shut, trapping Buffy in a small area of the sewers with the demons. She attempts to use the Initiative weapon that Professor Walsh gave her, but it is defective and doesn't work. Meanwhile, Riley is kept out of the way by being sent out with a team to find and recover Hostile 17.",
                "With Willow doing a spell to mask the tracer's signal from the Initiative to buy them time, and Spike passed out from drinking, Giles continues his attempts to get the tracer out of the vampire's shoulder. It is finally removed and flushed down the toilet just in time to save Spike from Riley and his team.",
                "Buffy fights with the two demons, while Professor Walsh watches a screen at the Initiative that is hooked up to the feeds from Buffy's monitor and camera. Buffy fights and the heart monitor loses her heartbeat when she drops it to the ground. When Riley returns from his mission, Professor Walsh informs him that Buffy is dead, and makes up a story about Buffy going out on her own to attack some demons, despite protests from Maggie. At that point, having killed the two demons, Buffy comes on to the camera feed and informs Walsh that her attempts to kill her failed, promising to show her how powerful a Slayer really is. Riley sees this, and then walks out on Walsh, while she's pleading with him to come back.",

Faith attends a meeting at Giles's apartment with Xander, Willow, and Anya, who makes Faith uneasy, as she has no idea who Anya is. Faith happily tells the gang Faith is on her way to prison, but Giles tells them this is unlikely as\u00a0the Watcher's Council has sent a team to apprehend the rogue slayer and take her back to England, meaning they are unlikely to see her again.

When Willow goes to get drinks, Faith makes no effort to maintain Buffy's persona and says several rude, harsh things to Tara.

However, the other members, Collins and Weatherby, tell her that they all settled their affairs before leaving for the mission and are prepared to die if it means accomplishing it. They then tell her to do what she wants and, unable to go through with her threat, Buffy is forced to let Smith go.

Willow thinks that means that their friends aren't accepting their romantic relationship.",
                "Riley hears that there is trouble on the streets through his radio and goes to check it out. He finds that it is Angel fighting off the commandos, and Riley refuses to let Angel go see Buffy. The two have a brutal fight, of which Angel is clearly the victor. Since the fight is personal for both combatants, no punches are pulled. Angel, who normally refrains from using his superior physical strength against a human and still stinging from Buffy's recent comments in LA, holds nothing back in the fight. Similarly, Riley, having just learned what makes Angel lose his soul, uses every weapon on him.",
                "The fight ends when Riley, having momentarily stunned Angel with his taser, is lifted by Angel and thrown into several trash cans. Angel then picks him up again and throws him once again into the side of a building. Finally, both run off when a military truck comes down the street. Buffy returns to her dorm room and Angel shows up. As Angel tries to talk to Buffy, Riley barges in and points a gun at Angel. Angel taunts Riley and the two come to blows again. Buffy separates them and wants to talk to Angel alone. Riley refuses to leave the room, so Buffy and Angel depart to the hallway, though not before Angel taunts Riley with a superior smirk.",
                "Buffy goes off on Angel and then they laugh when Angel confesses he came to make up. Angel admits that he had no right to talk to Buffy like he had before, and explains that he had been attacked by the Initiative soldiers and Riley only waded into the middle of it and immediately accused him. Accepting, Buffy also admits that Angel was not entirely wrong; the two are no longer a part of the other's worlds, and she had no right to barge in on his. Having concluded his business, Angel leaves, stating that he doesn't like Riley, and Buffy thanks him, amused and grateful towards his jealousy.",
                "Spike reports back to Adam, happy to have split up the Scooby Gang. He dubs his plan The Yoko Factor. Riley is worried that Buffy has reunited with Angel, and confesses that he already knows about how Angel can lose his soul, which set him off. They profess their love to each other and then Buffy brings him bad news. She tells him that Forrest is dead and he leaves quickly.",
                "Everyone meets at Giles's house, and Buffy intends to go back to the cave believing that Adam wouldn't have been there for no reason. As Giles gets more drunk and more bitter about the fact that Buffy doesn't need him anymore, Buffy declares she's going to the cave alone. Both Willow and Xander (with Spike's words ringing in their minds) take exception at this; Xander believing that Buffy only needs him around for menial takes and accuses her of this. Buffy defends herself, and gets angry at Xander for telling Riley the full details about her relationship with Angel. Tara and Anya sneak into the bathroom and hide. Soon personal feelings start to come up, as Willow makes her dislike of Xander and Anya's relationship vocal (particularly, the fact she and Xander are hardly apart) and accuses Buffy of not taking her seriously and being uneasy with her since discovering Tara was her girlfriend. Xander begins to argue that Buffy and Willow forgot about him when they went off to college, then realizes what Willow has just said and is shocked, with a \"bloody hell\" coming from Giles who has gone upstairs.",
                "By now, Buffy has had enough of her supposed friends attacking her, and angrily asks how they could possibly help her? Xander and Willow are stunned into silence by these hurtful words, and Buffy declares she's on her own and can see why the prophecies never mention a Chosen One having friends. As she leaves, she tells everyone she's going to someone she can count on.",

She pauses, confused, stake raised, and then hesitates. They stare at each other for a moment, and then he pulls her into a kiss. She pulls back, shocked, but then returns to the embrace. She tells Spike, \"I want you,\" and he tells her: \"I love you Buffy. I love you so much.\"",
                "Spike then awakens from his dream, gasping beside a still-sleeping Harmony. He says: \"Oh god no. Please, no.\""

Buffy has the upper hand, but when she attempts her killing blow, the vampire turns her stake around on her, and she is stabbed in the abdomen. She attempts to flee, but is cornered, and the vampire, wielding her stake, is about to finish her off, but Riley appears at that moment and fights him off before going to see to Buffy.",

While Riley suggests she go to the hospital, Buffy feels it would only upset her mother, and her enhanced healing abilities will kick in soon enough. Dawn comes in to tell them Joyce is coming up, prompting Riley and Buffy to hide the gauze and medical supplies they were using. Joyce notices a bottle of rubbing alcohol and asks if they are disinfecting something, prompting Dawn to say it was hers. Buffy asks Riley to take the rest of the gang to sweep the cemetery that night.",
                "Meanwhile, Buffy, rattled after nearly being killed despite having increased her training, does research with Giles to find out how previous Slayers died and what it was that made their last battles special, but they are unable to find any useful information, mostly because past Watchers either found the subject too painful or were killed along with their Slayers. Giles notes that unfortunately it seems there's no one left who has witnessed a Slayer's last battle, but then Buffy realizes she knows someone who can help. She then confronts Spike in\u00a0his crypt. When he demands to know what he did, she tells him that she wants to know how he managed to kill two Slayers.",
                "Later, at the Bronze, she lays down ground rules: if he tells her what she wants to know, Spike gets a wad of money. Though initially resistant to giving her anything useful, Spike barters with her for a plate of spicy Buffalo wings, as he refuses to talk on an empty stomach. In doing so, Buffy inadvertently reveals her stab wound, leading Spike to annoy her further. Asked if he's always been this annoying, Spike says: \"I've always been bad.\"",
                "London, 1880 \u2014 That assertion is belied, however, by the quiet, shy, rather foppish gentleman Spike used to be \u2014 a young poet named William. While at a society ball, he works on a love poem, looking for another word for \"gleaming,\" but his unfinished work is snatched from his hands and read out loud, to the rude amusement of the boorish crowd. William is dubbed \"William the Bloody\" because of his \"bloody awful poetry.\" One listener declares that he would rather have a railroad spike through his head than hear more of William's poetry.",
                "The poem reveals his feelings of love and adoration for a woman. He speaks with the object of his affection, Cecily, whom he has loved from afar. She does not care for him and when he admits the poem is about her, she rejects him, telling him that she feels nothing for him and that he is \"beneath\" her. William, devastated, leaves the house in tears, bumping into a group of strangers in the street. In a hay barn, he sits ripping up his love poems, when Drusilla appears before him. She asks what brought him to tears and comforts him by telling him that she sees his greatness and worth. She promises him a better future by her side, siring him after only minimal persuasion.",
                "Back in the present, Riley and the gang find several vampires loudly and drunkenly reveling in a crypt, including the one who staked Buffy. They decide to return in the morning when all the vampires are asleep, rather than take on the entire nest awake. Spike plays pool while continuing his tale. After his siring, Spike was completely different. Tired of being left out by the world, he became empowered and destructive and decided he needed to get himself a gang.",
                "Yorkshire, 1880\u00a0\u2014 Angelus throttles William at the bottom of a coal mine, asking why they haven't killed him yet. William, now having adopted his distinctive accent and swagger, notes that he goes by the name \"Spike\" now. Spike's strong tendency to incite mob riots simply for the joy of the fray is causing trouble for his new vampire family; his most recent hijinks resulted in their having to hide in an abandoned mineshaft which angers Angelus as he likes to treat himself and his women to luxury. Angelus feels that Spike's uncouth behavior is putting them increasingly in danger from being hunted by angry mobs. Spike feels Angelus only engages in fights that he knows he will win, rather than fighting with zeal and veracity. Angelus prefers the artistry of killing, seeing it as separating them from being mere animals. Spike's insults finally cause Angelus to lash out viciously, and he very nearly stakes Spike before Spike notes that he has proved his point. The elder vampire notes that if he cannot teach Spike the error of his ways, someday an angry mob would; that or the Slayer. Spike sits up, suddenly interested, and asks: \"What's a Slayer?\"",
                "Spike explains to Buffy that thereafter, he became obsessed with finding and defeating the Slayer of that era. He notes, as the first lesson, that a Slayer must always reach for her weapon, but a vampire already has all the weapons he needs (he vamps out to demonstrate this). To illustrate this point further, he tells her of the first Slayer he killed.",
                "China during the Boxer Rebellion, 1900 \u2014 Spike fights with a Chinese Slayer. She cuts his left eyebrow, but she loses her sword, and Spike kills her before she reaches for her stake on the floor. Drusilla arrives and the two revel in the kill of the Slayer and the taste of her blood before having sex. Outside, Spike and Dru tell Angelus and Darla of the Slayer's death. Angelus offers halfhearted congratulations before suggesting they leave soon, as the rebellion is boring him.",
                "Spike claims that it was the best night of his life. Buffy is disgusted at how he got off on it, but he counters that even if Buffy kills tens of thousands of vampires in her lifetime, all it takes to kill a Slayer is for one vampire to have \"one good day,\" and that Buffy simply got complacent at the moment of truth. Meanwhile, Riley returns to the vampire nest alone, despite agreeing to wait. After staking the vampire that hurt Buffy, Riley blows up the rest of the vampires in the crypt with a grenade.",
                "New York, 1977 \u2014 Spike tells Buffy how he killed the second Slayer. Spike and Buffy fight out a play-by-play of the battle, which took place on a subway train. Spike notes that this second Slayer was not all business like the first \u2014 she had an improvisational style more closely resembling Buffy's. After he snapped the Slayer's neck, he took her black leather coat for himself. Spike then explains that the key to his victories was not in the particular moves or blows; the key was that each Slayer has a death wish, a desire to experience death, after causing so much of it, additionally claiming that Buffy also has this wish, but has ties to the world that keep her anchored.

                "In a routine patrol at the cemetery, Buffy fights with a vampire. Buffy has the upper hand, but when she attempts her killing blow, the vampire turns her stake around on her, and she is stabbed in the abdomen. She attempts to flee, but is cornered, and the vampire, wielding her stake, is about to finish her off, but Riley appears at that moment and fights him off before going to see to Buffy.",
                "The next morning, Riley patches up Buffy's stab wound; the embarrassing circumstance of nearly being killed by a lesser vamp with her own stake is not lost on her and leads Buffy to fear that she may be losing her edge despite Riley's reassurance. While Riley suggests she go to the hospital, Buffy feels it would only upset her mother, and her enhanced healing abilities will kick in soon enough. Dawn comes in to tell them Joyce is coming up, prompting Riley and Buffy to hide the gauze and medical supplies they were using. Joyce notices a bottle of rubbing alcohol and asks if they are disinfecting something, prompting Dawn to say it was hers. Buffy asks Riley to take the rest of the gang to sweep the cemetery that night.",
                "Meanwhile, Buffy, rattled after nearly being killed despite having increased her training, does research with Giles to find out how previous Slayers died and what it was that made their last battles special, but they are unable to find any useful information, mostly because past Watchers either found the subject too painful or were killed along with their Slayers. Giles notes that unfortunately it seems there's no one left who has witnessed a Slayer's last battle, but then Buffy realizes she knows someone who can help. She then confronts Spike in\u00a0his crypt. When he demands to know what he did, she tells him that she wants to know how he managed to kill two Slayers.",
                "Later, at the Bronze, she lays down ground rules: if he tells her what she wants to know, Spike gets a wad of money. Though initially resistant to giving her anything useful, Spike barters with her for a plate of spicy Buffalo wings, as he refuses to talk on an empty stomach. In doing so, Buffy inadvertently reveals her stab wound, leading Spike to annoy her further. Asked if he's always been this annoying, Spike says: \"I've always been bad.\"",
                "London, 1880 \u2014 That assertion is belied, however, by the quiet, shy, rather foppish gentleman Spike used to be \u2014 a young poet named William. While at a society ball, he works on a love poem, looking for another word for \"gleaming,\" but his unfinished work is snatched from his hands and read out loud, to the rude amusement of the boorish crowd. William is dubbed \"William the Bloody\" because of his \"bloody awful poetry.\" One listener declares that he would rather have a railroad spike through his head than hear more of William's poetry.",
                "The poem reveals his feelings of love and adoration for a woman. He speaks with the object of his affection, Cecily, whom he has loved from afar. She does not care for him and when he admits the poem is about her, she rejects him, telling him that she feels nothing for him and that he is \"beneath\" her. William, devastated, leaves the house in tears, bumping into a group of strangers in the street. In a hay barn, he sits ripping up his love poems, when Drusilla appears before him. She asks what brought him to tears and comforts him by telling him that she sees his greatness and worth. She promises him a better future by her side, siring him after only minimal persuasion.",
                "Back in the present, Riley and the gang find several vampires loudly and drunkenly reveling in a crypt, including the one who staked Buffy. They decide to return in the morning when all the vampires are asleep, rather than take on the entire nest awake. Spike plays pool while continuing his tale. After his siring, Spike was completely different. Tired of being left out by the world, he became empowered and destructive and decided he needed to get himself a gang.",
                "Yorkshire, 1880\u00a0\u2014 Angelus throttles William at the bottom of a coal mine, asking why they haven't killed him yet. William, now having adopted his distinctive accent and swagger, notes that he goes by the name \"Spike\" now. Spike's strong tendency to incite mob riots simply for the joy of the fray is causing trouble for his new vampire family; his most recent hijinks resulted in their having to hide in an abandoned mineshaft which angers Angelus as he likes to treat himself and his women to luxury. Angelus feels that Spike's uncouth behavior is putting them increasingly in danger from being hunted by angry mobs. Spike feels Angelus only engages in fights that he knows he will win, rather than fighting with zeal and veracity. Angelus prefers the artistry of killing, seeing it as separating them from being mere animals. Spike's insults finally cause Angelus to lash out viciously, and he very nearly stakes Spike before Spike notes that he has proved his point. The elder vampire notes that if he cannot teach Spike the error of his ways, someday an angry mob would; that or the Slayer. Spike sits up, suddenly interested, and asks: \"What's a Slayer?\"",
                "Spike explains to Buffy that thereafter, he became obsessed with finding and defeating the Slayer of that era. He notes, as the first lesson, that a Slayer must always reach for her weapon, but a vampire already has all the weapons he needs (he vamps out to demonstrate this). To illustrate this point further, he tells her of the first Slayer he killed.",
                "China during the Boxer Rebellion, 1900 \u2014 Spike fights with a Chinese Slayer. She cuts his left eyebrow, but she loses her sword, and Spike kills her before she reaches for her stake on the floor. Drusilla arrives and the two revel in the kill of the Slayer and the taste of her blood before having sex. Outside, Spike and Dru tell Angelus and Darla of the Slayer's death. Angelus offers halfhearted congratulations before suggesting they leave soon, as the rebellion is boring him.",
                "Spike claims that it was the best night of his life. Buffy is disgusted at how he got off on it, but he counters that even if Buffy kills tens of thousands of vampires in her lifetime, all it takes to kill a Slayer is for one vampire to have \"one good day,\" and that Buffy simply got complacent at the moment of truth. Meanwhile, Riley returns to the vampire nest alone, despite agreeing to wait. After staking the vampire that hurt Buffy, Riley blows up the rest of the vampires in the crypt with a grenade.",
                "New York, 1977 \u2014 Spike tells Buffy how he killed the second Slayer. Spike and Buffy fight out a play-by-play of the battle, which took place on a subway train. Spike notes that this second Slayer was not all business like the first \u2014 she had an improvisational style more closely resembling Buffy's. After he snapped the Slayer's neck, he took her black leather coat for himself. Spike then explains that the key to his victories was not in the particular moves or blows; the key was that each Slayer has a death wish, a desire to experience death, after causing so much of it, additionally claiming that Buffy also has this wish, but has ties to the world that keep her anchored. They want to know what comes next because they wish for a final peace after a lifetime of being solely responsible for protecting the world from demons. Spike explains that the second that that desire takes over, the Slayer will die because there are countless vampires just waiting to take advantage of this, a conclusion that Buffy immediately rejects.",

They cuddle and invent new star constellations when they see a large object streaking through the sky and crashing down in Sunnydale. They investigate the crash site and decide to contact the other Scoobies. The crazy man that spoke to Dawn, who has been released from the hospital, is walking through the forest when a creature attacks him and kills him.",

The gang finds the location of the crash and a hollowed-out shell. They spread out the search and find the dead body of the mental patient. The gang leaves to do research, and Riley stays behind to investigate the scene. He calls Graham for military reinforcements and advises the soldiers how to deal with the situation when they arrive. They decide to try and track the creature by trace radiation.",

She tries to explain that when people are crazy, they think that nothing except themselves are real.",

At the Summers' home, Buffy and Dawn put their mother, whose mental clarity continues to deteriorate, to bed. Dawn listens from her bedroom as Joyce babbles loudly. At first, she appears to be talking to the ceiling; however, it is soon revealed that she is talking to the Queller demon, which is watching her from the ceiling. Dawn tries to ignore the babble, and Buffy, who is downstairs washing dishes, turns on loud music and begins to sob.",
                "In Joyce's room, the demon falls from the ceiling and spits a thick layer of slime onto Joyce's face. Dawn hears the commotion and runs to check on her mother. When she sees the demon attacking her mother, she comes to the rescue, knocking it onto the floor with a coat rack. It flees from the room, and Dawn slams all the doors and screams for Buffy. Buffy runs upstairs to check on her mother and sister. They tell her about the demon, and she chases it downstairs where she finds Spike coming out of her basement. He asks her if she heard a noise, and she notices that he has been stealing pictures of her, but the demon attacks before she has a chance to berate him.",
                "Together, they fight off the demon, and Buffy ultimately kills it with a knife while wrestling with it on the floor. Spike walks over and offers his hand to help her up. He pulls her to her feet, and their hands remain connected as Riley bursts through the door with the soldiers. Spike informed Riley that he had missed quite a show, making sure that Riley understood that Spike had been there to help.",
                "Back at the hospital, Ben gets into his car to find that Dreg is waiting in the backseat. Ben reveals that he is the one who summoned the Queller, intending to handle the town's expanding mentally ill population, which he describes as \"having to clean up Glory's mess,\" which he complains he has \"had to do\" for his entire life.",
                "In her hospital bed, Joyce has realized the truth about Dawn during her brief experience with insanity, which Buffy confirms for her. Joyce insists that Dawn is nevertheless her daughter, and urges Buffy to take care of Dawn in case anything goes wrong during the operation. While her daughters and the rest of the Scoobies watch on, Joyce is wheeled off to surgery."

It's simply a case of keeping her busy until her window of opportunity has passed. Anya continues to press for ideas\u00a0and points out two items the Scoobies have possession of that could help: the Dagon Sphere, which is supposed to repel Glory, and Olaf the Trollgod's Enchanted Hammer, which Buffy can easily wield. Buffy then points out the gang still have no way to find Glory,\u00a0when Tara suddenly starts trying to leave, babbling that she has places to be.

Dawn tells her that, while both are monsters, at least Glory is upfront about it. Glory boasts that she could have killed Buffy at any time, but didn't because of Ben's residual humanity. Dawn suggests that maybe Glory knew she couldn't take the Slayer. Glory doesn't take kindly to this\u00a0and tells Dawn that her big sister won't be turning up, and, even if she does, she might not be there to save her, but to kill her.",

Knowing they can't set off for Glory's location too soon, it's just a case of waiting for the right time. Giles apologizes to Buffy for suggesting that Dawn be killed, but explains that he promised to protect the world, and sometimes has to say or do what others feel they can't. Buffy understands, but warns him she'll stop him if he tries to hurt Dawn. The two reflect on the amount of times they've saved the world; while the apocalypse has been averted on several occasions, it feels like they've done it a hundred times. Buffy remembers how, despite her love for him, she sacrificed Angel to save the world and, although it broke her heart, she knew it was right. Now she feels she is being asked to sacrifice too much\u00a0and doesn't understand how she is meant to live in a world that demands so much from her. She then tells him how the Guide had told her that \"death is [her] gift,\" and she concludes that all a Slayer can ever be is a killer. Giles tells Buffy that he thinks she's wrong about that, but she says that, regardless of what the message meant, if Dawn dies then she's finished as the Slayer.",

Anya also notes that normally she would head for the hills during an apocalypse, but her love for Xander is preventing her. As she talks about her conflicted feelings, Xander proposes to her. Anya is initially angry, thinking that he's only proposing to look brave, because the world is going to end and he won't have to go through with it. Xander assures her that he doesn't think the world is going to end\u00a0and wants to spend the rest of his time on it with her. Anya tells him she'll accept only \"after the world doesn't end.\"",

Willow points out that the spells she used only worked for a couple of minutes, and Glory has likely prepared for that. She then tells Buffy she thinks she can reverse the brain-suck that Glory inflicted on Tara; not only this would restore Tara's sanity, but also weaken Glory. Xander and Anya return with the Dagon Sphere, as well as a couple of other ideas for slowing Glory down.",
                "It's time for Dawn to take her place for the ritual, and Glory instructs two of her minions to take her. Dawn struggles against them\u00a0and then sees what Glory's army of crazy people have been building: a huge tower on top of which Dawn will be placed to be bled.",

She leads them directly to the tower; however, Glory recognizes her and demands to know what she is doing there. Glory is then ambushed by Willow who reverses the brain-suck and returns Tara's sanity. Glory is left dazed and decides that she needs a brain to feed on.

Glory catches it, causing her severe pain for a few seconds, but she manages to crush it with ease. However, Buffy uses this time to run up and attack her, initially gaining the upper hand. Giles, Spike, and Anya attack the minions at the base of the tower, with the hope of breaking through to rescue Dawn. Meanwhile, Willow approaches a waking Tara, who now is able to recognize her girlfriend. The two kiss and hug each other, overjoyed in their reunion.",
                "Glory has regained her senses and punches Buffy hard enough for her head to fly off, revealing she was actually fighting the Buffybot. The real Buffy then sneaks up behind Glory and strikes her in the face with the enchanted hammer, which sends the hell-goddess flying. Dawn calls out to Buffy, who forces her way past Glory's minions and attempts to climb the tower, but Glory recovers and gives chase, with the two having a running fight as they try to prevent the other from reaching the top. Buffy is eventually thrown off the tower,\u00a0but manages to take Glory down with her, and the two fall to the ground, the hammer landing several feet away. Before Glory can take any action against Buffy, she is knocked off her feet by a wrecking ball operated by Xander. Buffy then grabs the hammer and begins to beat Glory with it. Glory reminds her she can't be killed, but Buffy is willing to settle for the pain and doesn't stop.",
                "At the top of the tower, Dawn is nervously watching the battle raging below. She is surprised to see Doc at the top of the tower. Dawn, unaware that he is a worshiper of Glory, cries to him for help. He instead pulls out a knife and advances on her.",
                "Giles, Anya, and Spike are not making any progress through the minions and fall back, but believe that they're winning since Glory can't get anywhere near Dawn either. Spike then notices that there is someone at the top of the tower along with Dawn. Willow communicates telepathically with Spike, telling him to run to the top of the tower and rescue Dawn, with Tara then using magic to knock all the guards away to clear a path. He takes his shot and sprints to the top of the tower. When he gets there, Dawn calls to him. Doc turns around and the two begin to fight. However, Doc proves to be far stronger and faster than suspected, allowing him to get the better of Spike and plunge a knife into his back. Doc questions why Spike, a vampire without a soul, is going through so much to protect a girl, and Spike answers he made \"a promise to a lady.\" Intending to make Spike break it, Doc gets behind him again and locks him in\u00a0a hold. Spike and Dawn share a horrified look, before Doc throws him from the tower, and Spike smashes into the ground below. Doc then proceeds to initiate the ritual himself.",
                "Buffy continues beating Glory, who then reverts to the form of the mortal Ben. Buffy gives him a message to deliver to Glory: she's missed her chance and they're to leave Sunnydale to never return, or Buffy will end both of them. As Buffy leaves, Giles approaches a panting Ben, who admits that he thought Buffy was going to kill him. Giles tells Ben that she couldn't do that, even though she knows that one day Glory will re-emerge and make Buffy, as well as the world, suffer for her act of mercy. Giles tells him that Buffy couldn't kill him because she's a hero... \"not like us.\" Giles then puts his hand over Ben's mouth, suffocating him.",
                "Doc begins to cut Dawn, and her blood drips off her foot. A portal opens in mid-air, from which all manner of demons and horrors emerge. Buffy runs to the top of the tower and Doc looks forward to taking on the Slayer, but she quickly pushes him off the top of it as she heads for Dawn. She unties her sister, but Dawn knows that it's already too late. Knowing the portal won't close until her blood stops flowing, Dawn plans to jump into the portal, believing that doing so would close it and save the world, even if she dies in the process. Buffy stops her, and then has a realization herself. She remembers when she told Dawn they both shared Summers blood, her earlier proclamation that the monks made Dawn out of her, and when the Guide told her that death was her gift.",
                "Buffy exchanges a few words with a crying Dawn, assuring her and to tell the others that she'll be ok and this is something she has to do. She runs to the edge of the tower and throws herself into the portal, enduring the supernatural energy for several seconds before it kills her which causes the portal to close.

Anya continues to press for ideas\u00a0and points out two items the Scoobies have possession of that could help: the Dagon Sphere, which is supposed to repel Glory, and Olaf the Trollgod's Enchanted Hammer, which Buffy can easily wield. Buffy then points out the gang still have no way to find Glory,\u00a0when Tara suddenly starts trying to leave, babbling that she has places to be. As Tara is being drawn to where the ritual is taking place, it'll be a matter of following her when the time comes.",
                "At Glory's new lair, Ben is now willingly going along with Glory's plan, and he gives Dawn some clothes that she needs to change into. He attempts to reassure her, but Dawn doesn't want to hear it and screams demanding that he change into Glory. The goddess herself appears\u00a0and wants to know why Dawn chose her over Ben. Dawn tells her that, while both are monsters, at least Glory is upfront about it. Glory boasts that she could have killed Buffy at any time, but didn't because of Ben's residual humanity. Dawn suggests that maybe Glory knew she couldn't take the Slayer. Glory doesn't take kindly to this\u00a0and tells Dawn that her big sister won't be turning up, and, even if she does, she might not be there to save her, but to kill her.",
                "At the Magic Box, Buffy is training with the punch bag as everyone else works on ideas. Knowing they can't set off for Glory's location too soon, it's just a case of waiting for the right time. Giles apologizes to Buffy for suggesting that Dawn be killed, but explains that he promised to protect the world, and sometimes has to say or do what others feel they can't. Buffy understands, but warns him she'll stop him if he tries to hurt Dawn. The two reflect on the amount of times they've saved the world; while the apocalypse has been averted on several occasions, it feels like they've done it a hundred times. Buffy remembers how, despite her love for him, she sacrificed Angel to save the world and, although it broke her heart, she knew it was right. Now she feels she is being asked to sacrifice too much\u00a0and doesn't understand how she is meant to live in a world that demands so much from her. She then tells him how the Guide had told her that \"death is [her] gift,\" and she concludes that all a Slayer can ever be is a killer. Giles tells Buffy that he thinks she's wrong about that, but she says that, regardless of what the message meant, if Dawn dies then she's finished as the Slayer.",
                "Xander and Anya finish having sex in the Magic Box's basement while supposedly looking for the Dagon Sphere, then get back to work looking for it. Xander suddenly finds the Buffybot that Spike had built, and Anya screams at the sight of a stuffed bunny, telling Xander it is an omen about the end of the world. Anya also notes that normally she would head for the hills during an apocalypse, but her love for Xander is preventing her. As she talks about her conflicted feelings, Xander proposes to her. Anya is initially angry, thinking that he's only proposing to look brave, because the world is going to end and he won't have to go through with it. Xander assures her that he doesn't think the world is going to end\u00a0and wants to spend the rest of his time on it with her. Anya tells him she'll accept only \"after the world doesn't end.\"",
                "Upstairs, Buffy asks Willow if she can use magic against Glory, given that the only time any of them have hurt Glory was when Willow attacked her. Willow points out that the spells she used only worked for a couple of minutes, and Glory has likely prepared for that. She then tells Buffy she thinks she can reverse the brain-suck that Glory inflicted on Tara; not only this would restore Tara's sanity, but also weaken Glory. Xander and Anya return with the Dagon Sphere, as well as a couple of other ideas for slowing Glory down.",
                "It's time for Dawn to take her place for the ritual, and Glory instructs two of her minions to take her. Dawn struggles against them\u00a0and then sees what Glory's army of crazy people have been building: a huge tower on top of which Dawn will be placed to be bled.",
                "Buffy heads back to her house to collect weapons with Spike in tow. For this, she invites him back into her house. Buffy asks Spike to protect Dawn, to which he promises. He tells Buffy he knows she'll never love him, but appreciates her for treating him like a man.",
                "Sundown approaches, and the gang know that it's the right time to leave and let Tara out. She leads them directly to the tower; however, Glory recognizes her and demands to know what she is doing there. Glory is then ambushed by Willow who reverses the brain-suck and returns Tara's sanity. Glory is left dazed and decides that she needs a brain to feed on. She then sees Buffy and orders her minions to guard the path up the tower.",
                "Glory is having trouble maintaining her composure\u00a0and believes it is due to what Willow did, until Buffy reveals the Dagon Sphere and throws it to her. Glory catches it, causing her severe pain for a few seconds, but she manages to crush it with ease. However, Buffy uses this time to run up and attack her, initially gaining the upper hand. Giles, Spike, and Anya attack the minions at the base of the tower, with the hope of breaking through to rescue Dawn. Meanwhile, Willow approaches a waking Tara, who now is able to recognize her girlfriend. The two kiss and hug each other, overjoyed in their reunion.",
                "Glory has regained her senses and punches Buffy hard enough for her head to fly off, revealing she was actually fighting the Buffybot. The real Buffy then sneaks up behind Glory and strikes her in the face with the enchanted hammer, which sends the hell-goddess flying. Dawn calls out to Buffy, who forces her way past Glory's minions and attempts to climb the tower, but Glory recovers and gives chase, with the two having a running fight as they try to prevent the other from reaching the top. Buffy is eventually thrown off the tower,\u00a0but manages to take Glory down with her, and the two fall to the ground, the hammer landing several feet away. Before Glory can take any action against Buffy, she is knocked off her feet by a wrecking ball operated by Xander. Buffy then grabs the hammer and begins to beat Glory with it. Glory reminds her she can't be killed, but Buffy is willing to settle for the pain and doesn't stop.",
                "At the top of the tower, Dawn is nervously watching the battle raging below. She is surprised to see Doc at the top of the tower. Dawn, unaware that he is a worshiper of Glory, cries to him for help. He instead pulls out a knife and advances on her.",
                "Giles, Anya, and Spike are not making any progress through the minions and fall back, but believe that they're winning since Glory can't get anywhere near Dawn either. Spike then notices that there is someone at the top of the tower along with Dawn. Willow communicates telepathically with Spike, telling him to run to the top of the tower and rescue Dawn, with Tara then using magic to knock all the guards away to clear a path. He takes his shot and sprints to the top of the tower. When he gets there, Dawn calls to him. Doc turns around and the two begin to fight. However, Doc proves to be far stronger and faster than suspected, allowing him to get the better of Spike and plunge a knife into his back. Doc questions why Spike, a vampire without a soul, is going through so much to protect a girl, and Spike answers he made \"a promise to a lady.\" Intending to make Spike break it, Doc gets behind him again and locks him in\u00a0a hold. Spike and Dawn share a horrified look, before Doc throws him from the tower, and Spike smashes into the ground below. Doc then proceeds to initiate the ritual himself.",
                "Buffy continues beating Glory, who then reverts to the form of the mortal Ben. Buffy gives him a message to deliver to Glory: she's missed her chance and they're to leave Sunnydale to never return, or Buffy will end both of them. As Buffy leaves, Giles approaches a panting Ben, who admits that he thought Buffy was going to kill him. Giles tells Ben that she couldn't do that, even though she knows that one day Glory will re-emerge and make Buffy, as well as the world, suffer for her act of mercy. Giles tells him that Buffy couldn't kill him because she's a hero... \"not like us.\" Giles then puts his hand over Ben's mouth, suffocating him.",
                "Doc begins to cut Dawn, and her blood drips off her foot. A portal opens in mid-air, from which all manner of demons and horrors emerge. Buffy runs to the top of the tower and Doc looks forward to taking on the Slayer, but she quickly pushes him off the top of it as she heads for Dawn. She unties her sister, but Dawn knows that it's already too late. Knowing the portal won't close until her blood stops flowing, Dawn plans to jump into the portal, believing that doing so would close it and save the world, even if she dies in the process. Buffy stops her, and then has a realization herself. She remembers when she told Dawn they both shared Summers blood, her earlier proclamation that the monks made Dawn out of her, and when the Guide told her that death was her gift.",
                "Buffy exchanges a few words with a crying Dawn, assuring her and to tell the others that she'll be ok and this is something she has to do. She runs to the edge of the tower and throws herself into the portal, enduring the supernatural energy for several seconds before it kills her which causes the portal to close. Buffy's body lies at the bottom of the tower, where it is found by her friends.",

The gang are helped by the\u00a0Buffybot, who helps the group slay several vampires \u2014 and helps keep Buffy's death a secret from both the regular and the supernatural world. Willow has tried to make the robot behave more normally, but her tuning never really goes quite as planned. Although the Buffybot is doing its job fine, it also serves as a painful reminder of the friend they've lost.",
                "The next morning, Willow and Tara \u2014 who have moved into Buffy's house and are secretly acting as Dawn's guardians \u2014 prepare for the day, getting Dawn ready for school as Dawn prepares to take a phone call from her father who they are also trying to keep Buffy's death a secret from. At one point, the Buffybot, acting on its programming, hugs Dawn creating an awkward and uncomfortable moment, knowing that the robot is a pale imitation of the real Buffy. The Buffybot is sent to attend Parent's Day at Dawn's school. She behaves oddly, but the other parents hear her comments in Ms. Lefcourt's class as expressing concerns similar to their own and the Buffybot doesn't draw any suspicion.",

Xander arrives, and defuses the situation before taking Anya aside, as she admits that she wants to announce their engagement to the gang, but Xander doesn't want to go through with it while everything is still \"up in the air\" in regards to the issue that they're discussing with Willow and Tara that evening.",
                "That night, Spike stays with Dawn while the rest of the gang have a meeting. Dawn suggests that Spike can leave, but he steadfastly refuses, still feeling guilty that his failure to protect Dawn lead to Buffy's death. The two then start a card game. The Buffybot hunts a vampire but gets hit with a bottle and her motion skills are impaired. The vampire realizes the Slayer is a robot and quickly leaves.",

Xander, Anya and Tara are all feeling unsure that bringing Buffy back to life is the right thing to do, as something could go wrong. Willow insists, however, and\u00a0stresses that Giles, Spike, and Dawn cannot know, and that because Buffy was killed by mystical energy, they have a chance of bringing her back. She then tells the others of her worry that Buffy is suffering eternal torment in a hell dimension like Angel did and refuses to leave her there, and this makes them promise their support.",

Giles realizes he's trying to teach the Buffybot as if she were human, and the Buffybot responds that \"every Slayer needs her Watcher.\" Giles notes that, like any good Watcher, he got his slayer killed in the line of duty and that all slayer-watcher relationships end the same way, and now his job is done. The Buffybot innocently asks why Giles is still there, and Giles finds himself unable to come up with a reason.",

After Giles departs, Willow, Xander, Anya and Tara return home for final preparations and then head to the cemetery. They prepare the ritual, sitting around Buffy's grave and Willow begins the spell.

                "The Scooby Gang rush to find Buffy and figure she is at her house. The bikers are on the run now that Razor has been killed. At the house, Buffy is confused and acting weird as she surveys the changed scenery of her house and is told by Dawn that Giles has left. Spike arrives, angry and looking for Dawn. When Dawn and Buffy walk downstairs, Spike speaks to Dawn; although he initially thinks Buffy is the repaired Buffybot, he changes his mind when he gets a clear look at Buffy, while also realizing without being told that Buffy is back. He softens and helps clean up her wounded hands. They talk about how long she's been gone; Spike has counted the days, all 147 of them. When the Scooby Gang arrives and focuses on the Slayer, Spike slips out.",
                "Unable to stand all the concern, Buffy goes upstairs while Xander and Anya leave for food. Outside, the two find a hurt Spike, who's mad that he wasn't told about the plan to resurrect Buffy, despite having helped the gang all summer. He then realizes that his love of Buffy would have made him an obstacle if Buffy returned as something that would have had to have been destroyed. He warns Xander of the consequences they'll have to face, because they always exist with magic.",
                "After notifying Giles of Buffy's return, Willow and Tara go to bed and talk about the spell and changes in Buffy. In her room, Buffy looks at the pictures surrounding her and they briefly turn to pictures of skulls. During the night, Willow and Tara are visited in their room by Buffy, who yells at them and hints at Willow killing the fawn. When the girls get up to investigate, Buffy's asleep in her room and neither knows the source of the incident. A moving lump appears in the ceiling and motivates Willow to call Xander. In the background while Xander talks, Anya enters the room with a knife and smokey eyes, slitting her cheek before collapsing as the lump travels across the floor.",
                "The gang gather the next day for brainstorming, but no one is sure what this thing is and Buffy is still very closed off. At the Magic Box, Buffy still seems out of place and leaves to patrol alone. With Buffy gone, the demon has taken over Dawn, who shouts at her friends and breathes fire before collapsing. Buffy finds Spike at his his crypt and the two talk, rather awkwardly at first. Spike opens up to her, expressing his guilt for failing to save Dawn himself at the top of the tower which forced her to jump. He explains that every night afterward, he replayed the events in his head and always managed to save Dawn noting the only time he didn't do it was the only time it counted. The two then sit together in silence.",
                "Led on by Spike's hinting that Willow knew her spell might do something bad, Xander questions whether either of the witches knew the dangers, but is quickly quieted. Willow reveals that this creature was created by the spell that brought Buffy back. The demon currently does not possess a body, which is why it has been possessing members of the gang. A reversal of the spell will cancel out the creation of the demon, but it can't be done without also reversing Buffy's resurrection.",
                "After Dawn freaks out about the concept of losing Buffy again, Willow discovers that the demon can only survive if Buffy is killed. The demon, which had been housed in Xander's body while Willow shared this information, thanks Willow for the information and heads for the Slayer.",
                "Buffy is attacked by the formless demon which she can't hurt, but she can be hurt by it. Willow and Tara cast a corporealization spell on the demon. Buffy kills the now solid demon with an axe. Normality is somewhat resumed as Dawn heads to school the next day and Buffy sees her off. Buffy visits her friends at the magic shop and tells them that she was in Hell and she appreciates that they brought her back.",
                "Buffy goes outside behind the shop to be alone, where she finds Spike hiding in a patch of shade. He tries to talk to her and offers to help her if there is any way he can. She admits to him that although she wasn't initially sure, she knows that she wasn't in Hell, but in heaven, and her friends pulled her out. Spike listens silently as she tells him that this reality is her Hell. As Buffy leaves, she stresses that her friends can never know the truth."

While money is stolen from the bank, a security guard tries to intervene in the fight, but is unable to help the situation.

Dawn wants to help with research, but Tara thinks she's too young and that fact is proven when Dawn looks at a picture in one of the books.

The three guys argue both with the demon and each other, then Jonathan, Warren, and Andrew think up a way to accommodate the demon without killing Buffy.

Willow boasts about how scary the spell was, but Giles reminds her why such spells aren't practiced, including the possible consequences, noting that he left her in charge of the group because he thought she was the most responsible, which he now sees is clearly not the case.

Xander goofs around pretending to be a pirate, Dawn looks for stuff to take, Anya roller-skates around selling things, while Willow argues with a woman who is dressed as a stereotypical witch. Buffy runs into Spike in the basement, and the two have an awkward conversation in which Buffy thinks Spike is trying to get her into bed, but then he clarifies that he wants to go patrolling with her that night, notwithstanding the fact that supernatural forces typically don't operate on Halloween. The gang, who have been helping out all day, are worn out. Anya dances with Dawn as she counts her money. Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.",
                "The gang throws an impromptu party at Buffy's house for the two. When the lack of decorations is mentioned, Willow uses a spell to fill the room with them. While Anya is grateful, Tara and Giles share a concerned look.. Later in the kitchen Tara tries to talk to Willow about her casual and increasingly excessive use of magic, while Willow fails to see anything wrong with doing so. Dawn reminds Buffy that she is spending the night at her friend Janice's house. After Buffy approves, Dawn heads out to meet Janice for what is actually planned to be an evening of Halloween fun and teenage hijinks with two older boys named Zack and Justin.",
                "As Dawn, Janice, Zack, and Justin engage in some of the more violent Halloween pranks, breaking windows and damaging mailboxes, back at Buffy's place, Giles and Xander share a drink and talk about Xander's future. Xander almost seems to second-guess his marriage intentions and his future. Giles assures him that everything will be fine.",
                "Dawn and friends find themselves in front of Old Man Kaltenbach's house, Kaltenbach being reclusive and subject to rumor. After Janice refuses to approach the house, Dawn then bravely volunteers. As she lifts his pumpkin to smash it, the old man grabs her. Dawn's pals quickly rush her aid, but they are cheerily invited into the house. As it turns out, the man was actually a toy maker who is merely bitter about his toys becoming obsolete. Justin offers to help the old man with his special treat in the kitchen. As he prepares rice crispy treats for the kids, Justin vamps out, kills the old man, and steals his wallet. Zach and Justin debate whether to just eat Janice and Dawn, or turn them into vampires, too. Justin gives Dawn $10\u2014her portion of the money stolen from Kaltenbach, which she accepts without hesitation. Justin is impressed when Dawn tells him she has been stealing for a long time.",
                "Janice's mom calls Buffy's house and Giles figures out that Dawn has tricked them. He goes off to find Buffy; Anya, and Xander mind the house; and Tara and Willow head for the Bronze. Zack steals a car by killing the driver and the four teens begin making out. Janice and Zack then take off, leaving Dawn and Justin alone in the car. Justin then takes the opportunity to make his move and deliver Dawn her very first kiss.",
                "At the Bronze, Tara and Willow get into a fight when Willow proposes to magically shift everyone who isn't a 15 year old girl old into an alternate dimension to make Dawn easier to find. After Tara calls Willow out, Willow gets very angry and accuses Tara of taking Giles's side.",

Although Dawn is swept away in the moment, she manages to feel his lumpy noggin. Nearby, Buffy smashes the door in on Spike's crypt. He informs her of Dawn and her antics.

Xander goofs around pretending to be a pirate, Dawn looks for stuff to take, Anya roller-skates around selling things, while Willow argues with a woman who is dressed as a stereotypical witch. Buffy runs into Spike in the basement, and the two have an awkward conversation in which Buffy thinks Spike is trying to get her into bed, but then he clarifies that he wants to go patrolling with her that night, notwithstanding the fact that supernatural forces typically don't operate on Halloween. The gang, who have been helping out all day, are worn out. Anya dances with Dawn as she counts her money. Xander looks at her, and decides that the time has finally arrived to announce that he and Anya are engaged. The gang wishes the couple well but privately share their concerns with each other. As Anya gushes about wedding plans and being married, Xander starts to look uncomfortable.",

While Anya is grateful, Tara and Giles share a concerned look.. Later in the kitchen Tara tries to talk to Willow about her casual and increasingly excessive use of magic, while Willow fails to see anything wrong with doing so. Dawn reminds Buffy that she is spending the night at her friend Janice's house. After Buffy approves, Dawn heads out to meet Janice for what is actually planned to be an evening of Halloween fun and teenage hijinks with two older boys named Zack and Justin.",

Xander almost seems to second-guess his marriage intentions and his future. Giles assures him that everything will be fine.",

After Janice refuses to approach the house, Dawn then bravely volunteers. As she lifts his pumpkin to smash it, the old man grabs her. Dawn's pals quickly rush her aid, but they are cheerily invited into the house. As it turns out, the man was actually a toy maker who is merely bitter about his toys becoming obsolete. Justin offers to help the old man with his special treat in the kitchen. As he prepares rice crispy treats for the kids, Justin vamps out, kills the old man, and steals his wallet. Zach and Justin debate whether to just eat Janice and Dawn, or turn them into vampires, too. Justin gives Dawn $10\u2014her portion of the money stolen from Kaltenbach, which she accepts without hesitation. Justin is impressed when Dawn tells him she has been stealing for a long time.",

He goes off to find Buffy; Anya, and Xander mind the house; and Tara and Willow head for the Bronze. Zack steals a car by killing the driver and the four teens begin making out. Janice and Zack then take off, leaving Dawn and Justin alone in the car. Justin then takes the opportunity to make his move and deliver Dawn her very first kiss.",

Willow and Tara leave the discussion to enjoy the day, and Tara sings a love song to Willow about the difference she's made in her life, which leads them to their bedroom (\"Under Your Spell\").

She starts singing about her life, but is kidnapped by Sweet's minions, interrupting her song (\"Dawn's Lament\"). When Dawn wakes up in the Bronze, she and the three minions engage in an interpretive dance, which is Dawn's attempt to escape (\"Dawn's Ballet\").

                "Anya continues to try random spells, which makes many more bunnies, a dark green cloud to form inside the shop, and a skeletal beast to appear (which he must sword fight against). Giles and Anya argue while hiding behind the counter from an unseen growling beast and Giles reveals that he found a one-way plane ticket in his pocket for London, assuming he must be abandoning Anya. Eventually, Giles casts a banishing spell to remove everything. With the threats removed, Anya begs him not to leave her and they kiss passionately. Alex fights with the vampire chasing them in the sewers, finally staking it, and then accidentally steps on the crystal that fell from Willow's pocket. The breaking of the spell finds Giles and Anya kissing, Willow atop Tara after a fall, and Spike and Buffy deep in mid-action conversation.",
                "Tara and the others realize that Willow used magic, despite her promise. The spell broken, Buffy is momentarily too stunned to duck a few painful hits. Spike finishes off the rest of the vampires and promises to make up his debt to the intimidated Teeth. While Willow cries in the bathroom, Tara packs all of her things into boxes; then, receiving a hurt cold shoulder from Dawn, leaves. Full of grief, Giles takes his plane back to England. Spike finds Buffy at the Bronze, but she turns her face away and he stalks off. She doesn't let him get far though, and they kiss passionately beneath the stairs of the Bronze."

Xander worries about it, assuming it was probably Willow misusing magic, and he goes to talk to her.

Using her invisibility to its full advantage, she tricks the Doris into behaving in a bizarre manner and replaces the Summers report with pages consisting entirely of repetitions of \"All work and no play makes Doris a dull girl.\" The social worker tells her supervisor, who believes that she is having a mental break with reality and sends her home, saying that he will send someone else to re-inspect the Summers' home the next day.",

In the meantime, Xander confronts Willow, but she knows nothing about the invisibility and is offended that she is automatically being blamed. She leaves in a huff to try to figure out what happened to Buffy. Xander ends up meeting up with Willow at the site of Buffy becoming invisible. Willow keeps being tempted by magic, but uses her brains and deduction instead of magic, and figures out that the perpetrators are the drivers of the black van they've been seeing around Buffy. She gives Xander a traffic cone that was also made invisible, and he takes it back to the Magic Box. Xander and Anya do research, and discover that the invisibility ray is causing the structure of the traffic cone to break down. Anya is too self-involved to realize the implications, but Xander realizes that the same thing will happen to Buffy if the invisibility isn't reversed.",

He finds no problem with that, but Andrew and Jonathan are upset and do not want to kill her, and so Warren grudgingly agrees to fix her. Xander then runs to Spike's crypt in search of Buffy, where he finds Spike in bed. He's actually having sex with Buffy, but to Xander's eyes, Spike looks naked and alone, and Spike explains that he's doing push-ups. Xander has a chat with Spike, wanting to know where Buffy is, and Spike honestly says that he hasn't \"seen\" her. Throughout the conversation, invisible Buffy gropes and physically teases Spike. Spike tries to act normal, somewhat unsuccessfully. Xander finally leaves, disgusted by Spike's odd behavior, telling Spike that he really needs to get a girlfriend.",
                "Buffy wants to continue their physical activities, but Spike tells her that he is tired of being with her and not really having her. He says the only reason she came to see him is that she thinks she's not really there, because she's invisible. He asks her to leave if she isn't really going to be with him. He is frustrated with her carefree attitude and doesn't appreciate the way she seems to be using the invisibility as an excuse to escape her real life. She protests, but eventually leaves. She doesn't do too well at home when she scares Dawn, who has the same frustrations as Spike, combined with extreme worry for her sister. The bad stuff keeps on coming when she gets the message from Xander and Anya on the answering machine about the effects of the invisibility ray. Meanwhile, Willow has looked up the van by hacking into the DMV records, and has figured out who owns it. She goes into their lair in Warren's mother's basement, but is captured by the Trio, who have made themselves invisible. Jonathan then calls Buffy (disguising his voice so she can't identify him) and tells her that The Trio has kidnapped Willow and tells her to meet them at the arcade.",

Warren lies to Buffy, telling her that he is going to reverse the mechanism into making her visible. But Willow points out that he's put it on a setting that is going to kill her. Warren knocks her to the ground and aims the gun at Buffy, telling her that she can't see them. However, what he didn't count on was Buffy's Slayer training and experience, providing her with some ability to sense the invisible villains. A scuffle ensues. Warren ends up in the ball-pit, Andrew ends up in the pinball machine, and Buffy ends up holding Jonathan. Willow, who has changed the frequency, aims at Buffy, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren, making all four visible again.",

Warren stands firm, proclaiming himself and the others to be Buffy's \"archnemesises-ses.\" After a smoke-bomb goes off and after scuffling to open the door, The Trio escape. Buffy and Willow sit on the curb outside and talk about their struggles today: Willow explains that while she found the Trio without magic, she was tempted to use it while Buffy admits that, while she's still struggling with being alive, when she learned the full effects of the invisibility ray she realized she doesn't want to die.

Buffy tries to explain, saying it's \"magic weed.\" Doris sees Spike and gets the impression that Buffy has a punk boyfriend who is sleeping over with her, since he has a blanket. Doris also appears to disapprove of Buffy living with another woman, one who is sleeping during the daytime. Doris tells Buffy that her case does not look good and she will recommend immediate probation, and Buffy might lose custody of Dawn later on. After Doris leaves, Buffy angrily snaps at Spike when he asks how the visit went. Angry and hurt, Spike snatches his lighter back from Buffy who had put it in her front pocket and as he leaves he call out \u201cSo long, Goldilocks.\u201d Alone in her bedroom, Buffy cuts a lot of her hair off, then she goes to a hair salon and asks the hairdresser to make her look \"different.\"",
                "The Trio are just outside, about to make themselves invisible so they can see naked women inside a spa. However, when they see Buffy, Andrew and Jonathan panic and start a tug of war over who is going to use it first. They accidentally overload the invisibility ray and the beam hits Buffy, making her waver and vanish (along with a dumpster, traffic cone, and fire hydrant).",
                "Anya and Xander are planning their upcoming wedding at the Magic Box. The door opens but no one enters. Buffy's voice comes out of nowhere \u2014 she is having fun being invisible. Xander worries about it, assuming it was probably Willow misusing magic, and he goes to talk to her. Buffy goes out to have invisible fun in Sunnydale. \"I'm the ghost of fashion victims past,\" she moans to a woman, wearing an outdated cap. She then drives off with a parking inspector's van.",
                "Buffy drives to the Department of Social Services. Using her invisibility to its full advantage, she tricks the Doris into behaving in a bizarre manner and replaces the Summers report with pages consisting entirely of repetitions of \"All work and no play makes Doris a dull girl.\" The social worker tells her supervisor, who believes that she is having a mental break with reality and sends her home, saying that he will send someone else to re-inspect the Summers' home the next day.",
                "Buffy then heads to Spike's and begins touching and grabbing him, until he realizes who she is. \"I told you to stop trying to see me,\" she finally jokes and then she and Spike go underground for sex. In the meantime, Xander confronts Willow, but she knows nothing about the invisibility and is offended that she is automatically being blamed. She leaves in a huff to try to figure out what happened to Buffy. Xander ends up meeting up with Willow at the site of Buffy becoming invisible. Willow keeps being tempted by magic, but uses her brains and deduction instead of magic, and figures out that the perpetrators are the drivers of the black van they've been seeing around Buffy. She gives Xander a traffic cone that was also made invisible, and he takes it back to the Magic Box. Xander and Anya do research, and discover that the invisibility ray is causing the structure of the traffic cone to break down. Anya is too self-involved to realize the implications, but Xander realizes that the same thing will happen to Buffy if the invisibility isn't reversed.",
                "Meanwhile, Warren is trying to fix the invisibility ray but says that Buffy will die from the overload of radiation she is getting while she continues to be invisible. He finds no problem with that, but Andrew and Jonathan are upset and do not want to kill her, and so Warren grudgingly agrees to fix her. Xander then runs to Spike's crypt in search of Buffy, where he finds Spike in bed. He's actually having sex with Buffy, but to Xander's eyes, Spike looks naked and alone, and Spike explains that he's doing push-ups. Xander has a chat with Spike, wanting to know where Buffy is, and Spike honestly says that he hasn't \"seen\" her. Throughout the conversation, invisible Buffy gropes and physically teases Spike. Spike tries to act normal, somewhat unsuccessfully. Xander finally leaves, disgusted by Spike's odd behavior, telling Spike that he really needs to get a girlfriend.",
                "Buffy wants to continue their physical activities, but Spike tells her that he is tired of being with her and not really having her. He says the only reason she came to see him is that she thinks she's not really there, because she's invisible. He asks her to leave if she isn't really going to be with him. He is frustrated with her carefree attitude and doesn't appreciate the way she seems to be using the invisibility as an excuse to escape her real life. She protests, but eventually leaves. She doesn't do too well at home when she scares Dawn, who has the same frustrations as Spike, combined with extreme worry for her sister. The bad stuff keeps on coming when she gets the message from Xander and Anya on the answering machine about the effects of the invisibility ray. Meanwhile, Willow has looked up the van by hacking into the DMV records, and has figured out who owns it. She goes into their lair in Warren's mother's basement, but is captured by the Trio, who have made themselves invisible. Jonathan then calls Buffy (disguising his voice so she can't identify him) and tells her that The Trio has kidnapped Willow and tells her to meet them at the arcade.",
                "Buffy does so. However, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren have also made themselves invisible, and Warren is holding Willow hostage. Warren lies to Buffy, telling her that he is going to reverse the mechanism into making her visible. But Willow points out that he's put it on a setting that is going to kill her. Warren knocks her to the ground and aims the gun at Buffy, telling her that she can't see them. However, what he didn't count on was Buffy's Slayer training and experience, providing her with some ability to sense the invisible villains. A scuffle ensues. Warren ends up in the ball-pit, Andrew ends up in the pinball machine, and Buffy ends up holding Jonathan. Willow, who has changed the frequency, aims at Buffy, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren, making all four visible again.",
                "\"So, you three have what? Banded together to be pains in my ass?\" Buffy asks. Warren stands firm, proclaiming himself and the others to be Buffy's \"archnemesises-ses.\" After a smoke-bomb goes off and after scuffling to open the door, The Trio escape. Buffy and Willow sit on the curb outside and talk about their struggles today: Willow explains that while she found the Trio without magic, she was tempted to use it while Buffy admits that, while she's still struggling with being alive, when she learned the full effects of the invisibility ray she realized she doesn't want to die. The two friends sit and reflect on their small but significant steps to overcoming their problems."

She is soon disoriented as time seems to jump between the crying woman, an attack by several demons, and Spike finding Buffy in the woods. In the end, Buffy strikes out at something and instead of hitting one of the demons, she hits the woman: Katrina. Her body rolls down the hill as Buffy rushes behind trying to catch her. When Buffy finally does catch up, she realizes that Katrina is dead and assumes that the blow she dealt killed her.",
                "Behind a tree, another Katrina watches. Spike escorts Buffy away from the scene and back to her house. Warren is pleased with the success of their scheme. The Katrina double returns to the van and shifts appearance to reveal a Jonathan.",
                "That same night, Buffy dreams of Spike joining her and comforting her in her bed. Her dream shifts and they're in his crypt with her on top and Spike bound by the handcuffs. With Buffy still on top, Spike becomes Katrina and the crypt becomes the woods. Her dream shifts again and Buffy lowers a stake to Spike's chest. When Spike becomes Katrina again, Buffy asks her: \"Do you trust me?\" Katrina's now cloudy eyes open wide as the stake is shoved into her chest.",
                "Shaken by her dream, Buffy wakes and dresses and then goes to Dawn's room. She professes her love to her sister and then admits that she was involved in an incident earlier that night and that she has to go to the police about it. Dawn is alarmed at the possibility of losing her sister and lashes out, accusing Buffy of running away and deserting her loved ones.",
                "Spike catches Buffy outside the police station and tries to stand in the way of her turning herself in to the police. He says that he took care of the body, but then two cops passing by reveal that the body was found washed up by the river. Despite this, Spike is still determined to stop her from admitting guilt. He tells Buffy that, having saved thousands of lives, she shouldn't have to pay for accidentally taking one. As Spike vamps out and attempts to physically restrain her from going to the police, Buffy takes out her anger on Spike, and he does not retaliate, saying that she should \"put it all on him.\" She punches Spike repeatedly in the face, declaring that he is evil and soulless, that there is \"nothing good or clean\" in him, that he's dead inside and can't feel anything real.",
                "Buffy stops beating him, shocked by what she did, and walks dazedly away. She enters the police station and overhears that the girl in the woods was Katrina Silber, whom she now recognizes as Warren's ex-girlfriend. Immediately guessing the truth, Buffy leaves without discussing the incident with the police.",
                "The Scooby Gang research and find that the demons Buffy encountered in the woods caused the time shifting, concluding that Katrina was dead long before Buffy even encountered her. Buffy knows Warren is connected to the incident, and this deepens her resolve to find the Trio and ensure they pay for everything they've done.",
                "The Sunnydale police rule Katrina's death as suicide. Warren is very pleased that his plan to get rid of Katrina's body worked, with the only disappointment being that Buffy didn't actually take the fall for his crime. Warren tells his partners that she'll be taken care of when the time comes. Andrew starts to enjoy the fact that the Trio got away with murder, but Jonathan is uncomfortable as he starts to realize just how deep they've gone.",
                "Tara reports to Buffy that her research pointed out that the spell didn't bring Buffy back \"wrong\"; the only effect the process of re-materializing had on Buffy was something akin to a molecular suntan. This effect didn't make Buffy more or less human, but it was just enough of a change to \"fool\" Spike's chip. Buffy is shocked, and asks Tara to check again. Tara assures her she's certain, so she asks Buffy what's wrong. Buffy then implies that she allows more than just an exchange of punches to happen between her and Spike. Tara is supportive, first asking Buffy if she loves Spike because if she does, it's okay, since Spike did a lot of good the previous summer, and Tara believes he truly loves Buffy. Then Tara says that it's okay if she doesn't love him. Buffy tells that it can't be okay that she had been using Spike. She pleads for something to be \"wrong\" with her and breaks down crying in Tara's lap, asking to not be forgiven."

As her sister leaves, Buffy reads the letter from the assistant dean and finds that her application for re-admission has been rejected because she missed the deadline.

The demon strikes Sam and Riley rushes to help her as Buffy approaches the demon from behind and snaps its neck. Riley's shocked that she killed it and Buffy soon finds out from Sam that they weren't trying to kill it. Improvising, Sam takes a knife from Riley and cuts into the demon's gut as Buffy watches on, still confused.

Sam and Riley begin to describe the gory details of the demon and the mission and although Riley's concerned about Dawn hearing about it, Sam sticks up for the teen and she gets to stay with the \"grown-ups.\" Sam explains that the deadly Suvolte demon multiplies quickly and can destroy towns full of people in no time at all and has come to Sunnydale to lay a nest full of its offspring. A demonic dealer in Sunnydale by the name of the \"Doctor\" is suspected of holding the eggs in exchange for money.

Sam questions whether Buffy regrets losing Riley and although Buffy does a little, she certainly wouldn't try to change things now.

Later that evening, Buffy and Spike sleep under a blanket together and Spike wakes to find Riley has walked in on them. The vampire takes the opportunity to emphasize his having Buffy with him. Riley pretends not to care although he clearly does; he identifies Spike as the Doctor and demands to know where the eggs are.",

Buffy is unable to believe that Spike could be involved, but as she and Riley go to the bottom level of the crypt and find the eggs everywhere, Spike's cover is blown. Spike and Buffy exchange harsh words and as Spike leaves, the eggs begin to hatch. Little demons crawl out and begin to attack Buffy and Riley. The two escape and Buffy throws a live grenade down where the demons are, effectively destroying them and much of Spike's underground lair.",

Anya's bugged by the fact that Xander's so interested in Riley and Sam's marriage. Xander reassures her that while he's scared of the wedding, he's confident that the marriage will be great and last forever. Buffy and Riley talk privately and Riley asks her if she wants the \"Doctor\" to be taken out. Verbally admitting to her involvement with the vampire, Buffy denies his offer and accepts the fact that her life sucks and her ex-boyfriend is there to see it. Riley though tells her that struggling with life like a human being doesn't make her any less of a woman. Buffy tries to apologize for what happened when he left, and again Riley acts stoic, hiding his feelings.",

A helicopter arrives and carries the married couple off into the night. The next day, Buffy finds Spike at his crypt and although she doesn't care about his being the Doctor, she brings with her news he does not want to hear. Buffy tells Spike that although she has feelings for him, she can never love him; it would be wrong to keep using him the way she is, so it is over. Spike thinks that this is her usual routine of playing hard to get, but Buffy is serious and walks out with a final goodbye."

At the Bronze, Anya and Xander snack on chips while agonizing over the seating arrangements for the wedding reception and other jobs that need completing before the big event. Dawn and Willow sit and have drinks while discussing Xander and Anya's wedding and Willow's newly changed relationship with Tara. Although the two are far from getting back together, there's an open door on communication. Meanwhile, at home, Buffy works to remove the grass stains from her coat.",
                "The next morning, Buffy wakes up amidst her unfolded laundry to the sound of the garbage truck. She rushes to get the garbage outside in time, but the truck drives away. Dawn prepares to leave for school as Buffy returns inside and finds a letter from UC Sunnydale waiting for her. As her sister leaves, Buffy reads the letter from the assistant dean and finds that her application for re-admission has been rejected because she missed the deadline. At work, Buffy tends to the grill like a depressed robot with life offering her little more than her fast food job. Todd decides to send Buffy up to the counter while he prepares the food. The first person in line though is not someone she expected to see: Riley.",
                "Buffy leaves her position to help Riley. They battle but lose track of the monster on the streets of Sunnydale. Riley and Buffy pursue in his car. They talk of catching up as she changes into more appropriate clothing Riley had brought along. A brief interlude show Xander and Anya having a spat while sitting in traffic. At a dam, Riley and Buffy have further battles and lose the demon yet again. Buffy meets Riley's wife.",
                "Sam, as Riley later introduces as her, quickly jumps into a fight with the Suvolte demon. Buffy recovers from the shock of Riley being married and Riley starts to catch her up on his life since he left as they watch Sam deliver quite a beating to the demon. The demon strikes Sam and Riley rushes to help her as Buffy approaches the demon from behind and snaps its neck. Riley's shocked that she killed it and Buffy soon finds out from Sam that they weren't trying to kill it. Improvising, Sam takes a knife from Riley and cuts into the demon's gut as Buffy watches on, still confused. Sam observes that they're too late and the three head for Buffy's home where it should be safe. Riley mentions that Sam's good cutting skills are because she's a doctor and promises Buffy that he'll take the time to fill her in on everything.",
                "At the house, almost everyone greets Riley with open arms \u2014 though Dawn is cool with him because of the way he left the last time. Privately, Willow offers to hate the new wife for Buffy but Buffy, who is unable to really hate her herself, doesn't want to be petty. Sam and Riley begin to describe the gory details of the demon and the mission and although Riley's concerned about Dawn hearing about it, Sam sticks up for the teen and she gets to stay with the \"grown-ups.\" Sam explains that the deadly Suvolte demon multiplies quickly and can destroy towns full of people in no time at all and has come to Sunnydale to lay a nest full of its offspring. A demonic dealer in Sunnydale by the name of the \"Doctor\" is suspected of holding the eggs in exchange for money. The topic of Willow doing magic to help is raised, but Willow explains that she cannot.",
                "Riley directs Sam and Buffy to search for the nest while he investigates the dealer. In the kitchen, Sam tells Willow about a couple of shamans she knew that got addicted to magic and literally didn't survive it. She's amazed that Willow is strong enough to beat the addiction and Willow says nothing, but really takes the words in. Buffy and Sam patrol and talk about Buffy's honorable reputation as the Slayer and of course, Riley. Sam explains how she met Riley for the first time and how much Buffy mattered to him for so long. Sam questions whether Buffy regrets losing Riley and although Buffy does a little, she certainly wouldn't try to change things now. After Sam tells Buffy that Riley did get over her \u2014 after a year \u2014 she brings up the subject of Buffy's current love life and the Slayer dodges that subject.",
                "Buffy suggests they split up and as Sam heads off to find Riley, Buffy aims directly for Spike's crypt. Upon arrival, she questions his knowledge about the Doctor, but when he has no immediate answers, she changes the subject to his feelings for her and eventually pulls him to her for some physical comfort. Later that evening, Buffy and Spike sleep under a blanket together and Spike wakes to find Riley has walked in on them. The vampire takes the opportunity to emphasize his having Buffy with him. Riley pretends not to care although he clearly does; he identifies Spike as the Doctor and demands to know where the eggs are.",
                "Spike denies knowing anything about the code name \"Doctor\" or the whereabouts of the eggs, but Riley is confident with his information and starts to tear the place apart. Buffy is unable to believe that Spike could be involved, but as she and Riley go to the bottom level of the crypt and find the eggs everywhere, Spike's cover is blown. Spike and Buffy exchange harsh words and as Spike leaves, the eggs begin to hatch. Little demons crawl out and begin to attack Buffy and Riley. The two escape and Buffy throws a live grenade down where the demons are, effectively destroying them and much of Spike's underground lair.",
                "With family and friends causing mayhem in the apartment, Anya and Xander huddle together in the bathroom. Anya's bugged by the fact that Xander's so interested in Riley and Sam's marriage. Xander reassures her that while he's scared of the wedding, he's confident that the marriage will be great and last forever. Buffy and Riley talk privately and Riley asks her if she wants the \"Doctor\" to be taken out. Verbally admitting to her involvement with the vampire, Buffy denies his offer and accepts the fact that her life sucks and her ex-boyfriend is there to see it. Riley though tells her that struggling with life like a human being doesn't make her any less of a woman. Buffy tries to apologize for what happened when he left, and again Riley acts stoic, hiding his feelings.",
                "The whole gang gathers to say goodbye to Sam and Riley. While Riley explains to Xander where and how his brief and unromantic wedding took place, Sam and Willow confirm that they have each other's e-mail addresses for future contact (although Willow still calls Sam a \"bitch\" for Buffy's benefit). A helicopter arrives and carries the married couple off into the night. The next day, Buffy finds Spike at his crypt and although she doesn't care about his being the Doctor, she brings with her news he does not want to hear. Buffy tells Spike that although she has feelings for him, she can never love him; it would be wrong to keep using him the way she is, so it is over. Spike thinks that this is her usual routine of playing hard to get, but Buffy is serious and walks out with a final goodbye."

                "At the Magic Box, Willow starts to recover from Giles' attack, but she is not interested in his attempts to help. He tries to keep her down, but she is persistent, attempting to invoke Asmodea, so he is forced to bind her physically and magically with his powers. Buffy and Anya hug Giles, who then offers his sympathies to Willow and then catches up with Buffy. Giles reveals that he was given power from a coven of powerful witches in England to stop Willow. Buffy admits that Willow was abusing magic before and she barely even noticed. She then tells Giles how everything has gone downhill since he left including her taking a fast-food job, Xander jilting Anya (who returned to being a vengeance demon), Dawn's shoplifting, and her sleeping with Spike. Giles's reaction is the last one she expected; he begins to laugh at the absurdity of so much bad luck. Buffy is shocked at first, but ends up descending into laughter too.",
                "Meanwhile, Willow communicates with Anya telepathically and puts her under her thrall before telling her how to remove the binding spell. Buffy and Giles continue to laugh about the luck of their lives and then talk about Buffy's feelings about being alive in the world. Having heard everything that went wrong in his absence, Giles apologizes for leaving them in the first place, but Buffy insists that he was right and it was time she started acting like an adult. She admits that when he left, she still felt like she'd left an important part of herself in her grave and still doesn't know why she's back when it was apparently her time to die. Giles doesn't have a simple answer, so they return to discussing Willow and Giles explains that the coven is trying to extract Willow's powers without killing her. Willow appears in the doorway, holding an unconscious Anya, and reveals that she's free of the binding spell.",
                "Giles once again attempts to bind Willow, but she casts a counter spell. Willow magically throws Buffy aside and sends weapons flying at Giles. He blocks them though and, with the Hammer of Govannon, sends her flying through a brick wall into the main room. Meanwhile, Xander and Dawn walk down a road with Jonathan and Andrew, talking about what to do next. Xander again rambles on that he believes how useless he is, that he's really a coward because he did nothing when Warren shot Buffy and Tara, and did nothing at the Magic Box to stop Willow. When a smug Dawn mentions that Spike would help out and not be afraid, Xander lets it slip that Spike tried to rape Buffy. Dawn does not easily accept that.",
                "In the cave in Africa, Spike wins another round and asks for whatever else the demon can dish out. He gets it when his body is suddenly covered in beetles which begin to burrow under his skin, making him scream in pain.",
                "In the Magic Box, which has been almost completely destroyed from the magical battle, Willow is confident in her strength and a weakened Giles tries one last attempt to hurt Willow by bringing up Tara and what her thoughts on the situation might be. Willow responds with a bolt of magic, but Buffy saves Giles from the blast, which destroys the store's upper level. Willow notes that Buffy only thinks she's saving Andrew and Jonathan when she can destroy them anytime she wants. To prove this, Willow creates a fireball that she sends off after them which will also kill Xander and Dawn, making it clear that she's doing it to get Buffy out of the store. Despite the obvious lure, Buffy rushes off to try and stop the fireball, leaving Giles to face Willow alone.",
                "Willow lectures Giles while she slams his body repeatedly against the ceiling and the floor. He interrupts her with some magic, but she doesn't let that stop her. She sucks the power from Giles' body and revels in the overflow in her body. The magic she took from him though is accompanied by an emotional burst that makes her feel so much that she decides there's too much pain in the world and she must end it all.",
                "Xander, Jonathan, and Andrew try to break into crypts at the cemetery looking for a hiding place, but they're interrupted as Willow's fireball heads for them. Buffy races through the cemetery and tries to get everyone out of the way before they're hurt. After the fireball hits, Xander is knocked out, the ground shakes and opens up and Buffy and Dawn fall into a large hole. Andrew and Jonathan take the opportunity to escape and head for Mexico.",
                "At the Magic Box, Anya finally comes to and finds a weakened, dying Giles on the ground. He can feel Willow's presence and knows that she's going to end the world. Buffy tries to climb out of the hole but struggles and tries to pull coffins out of the surrounding dirt walls to stack and try to escape on. After Xander comes to, Buffy sends him to find some rope to help them get out.",
                "Dawn questions why Buffy didn't tell her about what Spike did and tells her sister that she can't protect her from the world. Anya appears in the hole and updates Buffy on the situation with Willow. On Kingman's Bluff, Willow raises the spire of a Satanic temple out of the ground to help her with her plans. Anya explains how Willow is going to end the world by using her powerful new-found magic to drain Earth's life energy though the effigy of Proserpexa, and that nothing magical or supernatural (including Buffy) can stop her. She notes that Giles is short on time and leaves to return to him.",
                "Xander, standing at the top of the hole, overhears this and runs off. Willow senses Buffy's desire to stop her plans, and talks to Buffy telepathically; Giles can also hear her as she speaks. Willow wants Buffy to die fighting and creates creature-like earth elements for her to battle. Buffy tries to fight the elements as best as she can and, outnumbered, Buffy asks Dawn to help.",
                "Willow begins her magic ritual on the cliff and the earth starts to shake all over town and ground begins to blacken. Willow is feeding power into the temple when Xander arrives. Finally breaking through his spiral of self-pity, Xander jumps in the way disrupting the flow of life-energy. He tries to reach her humanity through their friendship, but gets tossed around and magically injured. Giles stirs and realizes that there is still hope. After one of the elements attacks her, Dawn kills one, which she credits to watching her sister in action.",
                "On the cliff, the wounded Xander talks to Willow, and appeals to her emotions by reminding her of her past. He reminds Willow of a time in their childhood when she broke a yellow crayon and cried, worried about anybody finding out it was her, and tells her that he loves her and he'll stick by her side no matter what she does because of how much her years of friendship mean to him. She uses magic to physically wound him every time he tells her he loves her, until he finally gets through to her and her powers drain away. Willow tearfully breaks down in Xander's arms as the dark magic finally drains from her, the black veins on her disappear, and she returns to her usual red-haired appearance.",
                "No longer on the edge of death, Giles wakes up and tells Anya that the magic he received was intended for Willow to steal. It tapped into her remaining emotions and gave Xander the chance to reach her humanity. Anya is shocked to find that Xander saved the world. Back in the crypt, the Earth-creatures disappear, and Buffy starts to cry happy tears. Dawn questions whether instead she really wanted the world to end. Buffy assures her that she didn't and promises things are going to get better; she no longer has any regrets or resentment about being resurrected and feels ready to live, wanting to be there for Dawn and see the powerful woman she'll become. For the second time in a year, Buffy emerges from a grave but this time she feels truly alive. She helps Dawn climb out of the hole and the sisters check out the horizon while Xander continues to comfort Willow, Jonathan and Andrew hitch a ride toward Mexico, and Anya helps Giles to his feet and out of the wreckage of the Magic Box.",
                "In Africa, a severely bruised and bloodied Spike lies on the ground of the cave as the demon approaches him and announces that Spike has successfully endured all the required trials to grant his request. Spike rises to his knees and again asks the demon to give him what he wants so he can, \"give Buffy what she deserves.\" The demon places his clawed hand on Spike's chest and returns the vampire's soul."

Dead, the girl rolls to the side and says in a deep voice: \"From beneath you, it devours.\"",

Spike sneaks around in the basement of Sunnydale High, seemingly headed for a rat while he talks to himself. Everything around him begins to shake and he falls to the ground, screaming.",

At Sunnydale High, Principal Wood introduces Buffy to her new job and shows her the cubicle where she'll be working. She sneaks down to the basement in search of Spike but doesn't find him.",
                "In England, Willow struggles with the need to return to Sunnydale where she'll be forced to face her friends and the trouble she caused. A taxi awaits her as Giles listens to her verbalize her fears and he convinces her that even if her friends don't want her back, her presence on the Hellmouth will be important. Back in Sunnydale, a woman walks her small dog along the sidewalk, but while her back is turned, something sucks the dog through the pavement and into the ground. She runs away and right into Xander, who takes her to the safety of Buffy's house.",

Much to everyone's surprise, a cleaned up version of Spike joins them in the living room and offers his assistance in the battle. Spike wants to talk with Buffy, but Dawn and Xander are not happy to see him or with the fact that Buffy didn't inform them that she saw Spike earlier. Buffy goes to talk with Spike privately and he offers to help deal with this underground monster. Buffy eventually agrees to let him help, then explains the game plan to the rest of the group. As Spike leaves with Buffy for patrol, Dawn leaves him with a parting threat that if he ever again harms or touches Buffy, Dawn will set him on fire while he sleeps.",

Buffy is noticeably uncomfortable around him in the wake of his attempted rape, so he says that he won't bother apologizing for what he did, just admits to changing. Meanwhile, Xander takes Nancy home and she asks if they can go out sometime. The ground rumbles and a giant worm chases them down a hallway and emerges from the ground with a roar. Once the giant worm goes away and the two are safe, Nancy starts to talk about her ex-boyfriend and Xander quickly concludes that she made a wish to a vengeance demon.",

Anya realizes Spike has a soul, but Spike tries to stop her from spilling the news to the rest of the group. He starts to attack Anya and she turns on him, with her vengeance demon powers of strength. Buffy steps in and beats up on Spike while he instead hits her back with a verbal assault taunting her about their past sexual relationship. The fight sends Nancy on the run alone, but her wormy ex-boyfriend is on her trail. Meanwhile, Xander tries to convince Anya to reverse the curse on Ronnie, but it's not something she can do easily.",
                "Buffy arrives in time to rescue Nancy from the demon, but Spike intervenes, hitting it with a metal pole. He goes to stab the worm only to have it turn back into human form an instant before Spike makes contact. The chip activates as he stabs Ronnie in the shoulder, making them both scream in pain. Spike freaks out and talks crazy again, while Buffy calls the paramedics to help Ronnie. She notices when Spike says that \"from beneath you, it devours\" before running away. Anya and Xander arrive on the scene and Anya knows she will pay a steep price for reversing the spell.",
                "Buffy goes after Spike and finds him in a church. He's confused and speaks in metaphors of what he really is to Buffy; he tried to act like his usual self, but it was a costume and didn't work. He concludes that she's there to use him like she did before, so he unbuckles his belt telling her that it's time to service her. She attempts to stop him and throws him across the room. He tries to explain what he did to get the missing piece that would allow him to become what she wanted. He mutters that Angel should have warned him about \"the spark\" burning inside him, and with this Buffy understands he's talking about his soul. Spike continues to speak of all the voices that are in his head telling him to go to hell. Buffy, still shocked, asks him why would he do this. Spike explains that he did what he could to be a kind of man who would never try to hurt her and hopes to be forgiven and loved.

Spike wants to talk with Buffy, but Dawn and Xander are not happy to see him or with the fact that Buffy didn't inform them that she saw Spike earlier. Buffy goes to talk with Spike privately and he offers to help deal with this underground monster. Buffy eventually agrees to let him help, then explains the game plan to the rest of the group.

                "Outside, Buffy and Spike examining the scene where the dog was eaten. Spike explains that the manifest spirits from the school were the cause of his craziness. Buffy is noticeably uncomfortable around him in the wake of his attempted rape, so he says that he won't bother apologizing for what he did, just admits to changing. Meanwhile, Xander takes Nancy home and she asks if they can go out sometime. The ground rumbles and a giant worm chases them down a hallway and emerges from the ground with a roar. Once the giant worm goes away and the two are safe, Nancy starts to talk about her ex-boyfriend and Xander quickly concludes that she made a wish to a vengeance demon.",

Anya realizes Spike has a soul, but Spike tries to stop her from spilling the news to the rest of the group. He starts to attack Anya and she turns on him, with her vengeance demon powers of strength. Buffy steps in and beats up on Spike while he instead hits her back with a verbal assault taunting her about their past sexual relationship.

                "Buffy goes after Spike and finds him in a church. He's confused and speaks in metaphors of what he really is to Buffy; he tried to act like his usual self, but it was a costume and didn't work. He concludes that she's there to use him like she did before, so he unbuckles his belt telling her that it's time to service her. She attempts to stop him and throws him across the room. He tries to explain what he did to get the missing piece that would allow him to become what she wanted. He mutters that Angel should have warned him about \"the spark\" burning inside him, and with this Buffy understands he's talking about his soul.

                "Dawn and Cassie walk away from the school as Cassie reveals how she knows Buffy sent Dawn to befriend Cassie but it doesn't matter as the two are now clearly real friends. Just then a student named Peter approaches, and Cassie tells Dawn that nothing that is about to happen is her fault. Peter asks Dawn about the dance, but only to be a jerk, not to really ask her out. When an irritated Dawn turns back towards Cassie, she is gone, Peter having successfully distracted her.",
                "At the school that night, the cloaked group gathers again around a circle of coins and one of the boys turns out to be Peter. He checks with the others to make sure the school is secure and that no one can get in or out. Then, he pulls a bound and blindfolded Cassie out to the circle and holds a meat cleaver to her neck. She is to be a sacrifice to a demon that will provide the boys with \"infinite riches.\"",
                "As Peter starts the ritual, Buffy suddenly rips off a cloak, unveiling herself to the group and then smacks him around a bit. She doesn't think the ritual was a success, but a large demon, Avilas, appears behind her, proving her wrong. Buffy fights with the demon and Spike shows up with a flaming torch to help seeming to have at least temporarily regained his sanity as he doesn't want Cassie to get hurt. Buffy uses the torch to burn the demon while Spike cuts Cassie free from her bonds. Cassie tells him, \"Someday she'll tell you\" which shocks Spike and he retreats away. Desperately, Peter moves towards the fried demon and wants to know where his money is. The burned demon leans up and bites Peter on the shoulder once before exploding into dust.",
                "Buffy and Cassie walk away together, leaving Peter to deal on his own. A crossbow booby trap set by one of the cloaked boys nearly kills Cassie, but Buffy catches the bolt. Buffy is happy that she seemingly stopped Cassie's prediction, and tells the girl that one person can make a difference, to which Cassie responds that Buffy will. Just then Cassie gasps and unexpectedly falls to the ground, dead.",
                "The next day, the Scooby Gang gather at Buffy's and solemnly talk about how Cassie died because of a congenital heart defect. She was always going to die, no matter what happened. Buffy feels as if she failed Cassie, but a devastated Dawn corrects her, saying Buffy didn't fail, since she tried to save Cassie, and it was because of her that Dawn and Cassie were friends. Buffy returns to work, knowing that while she will always try her best, sometimes she just can't help."

                "Xander and Spike head out to meet with Lance Brooks, while Willow and Anya research love spells. Despite the fact that he was quite popular in high school, Xander and Spike find Lance has become a loser. After some chatting, the guys realize that the source of the problem is R.J.'s letterman jacket (adding some irony to Xander's earlier sarcastic remark about that jacket being the source of the seduction effect). In the meantime, R.J. shows up at the Summers' home, and after seeing him, Anya and Willow also fall in love. Eventually, the four girls fight over who loves R.J. the most, and decide to have a contest to see which of them is more ready, willing and able for R.J. As the three other girls head off, a depressed Dawn finds herself out-shadowed.",
                "The girls then go out of their way to prove their respective loves. Willow starts a spell to turn R.J. into a woman to fulfill her sexual orientation, Anya takes off to rob a bank, Buffy prepares to blow Principal Wood away with her old rocket launcher, and, finally, Dawn lays herself across railroad tracks.",
                "Xander and Spike return home just in time to stop Willow from completing her spell. They then head off to the high school to prevent Buffy from killing Principal Wood. After successfully distracting Buffy, the gang casts a locator's spell to find Dawn. They reach the train tracks just in time before a speeding train flattens the younger Summers. Buffy outruns the train and rescues her sister. Apparently, Dawn's attempted suicide knocks some sense into her, and in turn, Buffy tries to assure Dawn that no guy is worth her life. Dawn begins to see sense, and they return home that night. This time they try to hatch a plan to destroy R.J.'s letterman jacket. Without any trouble, Xander and Spike manage to take the letterman's jacket off R.J., before the Scoobies witness its burning in the Summers' fireplace.",
                "Buffy and Dawn reconcile, the love spell is broken, and everything is back to normal. Dawn apologizes for how she acted and talked to Buffy, and how stupid she felt that she \"did it over a spell\". Buffy forgives Dawn and tells her to \"be prepared to feel even stupider when it isn't\" over a spell. The girls lament about what they all 'almost' did. However, as they ask Anya what she almost did, she stalls. Then comes a news report about a wanted bank robber. Anya instantly takes the opportunity to switch off the radio and offers to buy them ice cream."

When he approaches her body, a robed figure attacks the man with a dagger, but the man fights back. Another robed figure joins in and soon, the man is stabbed and falls dead next to the young woman. Willow arrives at the Summers' house and finds the house a disaster and Dawn still in shock. Dawn tries to tell her what happened and how she saw Joyce, but Willow explains that it was a big evil messing with their minds.",
                "At Xander's apartment, Buffy and Xander talk about the possibility of Spike turning a human, even in spite of his chip. Buffy doesn't want to believe it because she knows the chip still works, but she and Xander have to wonder if maybe Spike's been acting all this time. Spike returns to Xander's apartment and receives a somewhat cold reception. In attempts to get a reaction from him about Holden Webster, Buffy mentions the encounter to Spike, but he reacts with complete calm and heads off to bed. Both having things to do, but not wanting to leave Spike alone, Xander gets a reluctant Anya to come over and stay with Spike. She doesn't like the idea of being stuck weaponless with Spike when he may be able to bite again. Xander tells her to call if Spike decides to go anywhere and then leaves for work.",
                "Buffy returns to find the downstairs of the house trashed from Dawn's encounter with the unknown, hostile entity from the previous night and freaks out until she finds Willow putting Dawn to sleep. Willow informs her about the \"evil\" visits she and Dawn had and Buffy tells Willow about her encounter with Holden. Buffy wonders if they've been victim of lies and tricks, or if something else has been going on. Armed with a stake, Anya quietly searches Spike's room and clothes while he sleeps, but he awakes and catches her. She tries to lie about her intentions, claiming to want sex, but Spike isn't interested in her offer and lets her down gently. After the sun sets, Spike leaves the apartment with an apology to Anya for any potentially hurt feelings. She quickly makes a phone call to Buffy about Spike's departure.",

Buffy follows him, keeping out of sight. He finds a woman standing around outside and the two talk and flirt before going off to an alley. Buffy tries to keep tabs on Spike, but she has a hard time following him through the crowd of people out walking the streets. Spike and the woman kiss against a wall and Spike pauses, looking up to see Buffy approach him and the woman. With a smile, she reminds him that she wants him to do it and he vamps and bites the woman, much to Buffy's pleasure.",

The form says, \"How could you use a poor maiden so.\" Later, Buffy barges in on a sleeping Spike, angrily demanding to know whether he killed the woman she saw him with. He reminds her that he can't kill anyone. She asks if it's because of the chip and he corrects her telling her that it's because of his soul and suspects that she's jealous. He doesn't deny talking to other women, but swears they mean nothing to him. He then reminds her of how far he went to prove his love for her -  choosing to get his soul, unlike the chip that was forced on him. Though visibly taken aback and moved by his words and emotion, Buffy gets confrontational about Spike killing people and although he doesn't remember everything, he's confident that he is innocent since he can barely live with the guilt of his past transgressions.

                "In the school basement, Spike has been strapped to a wheel and the Bringers are cutting symbols into his chest. The First talks to Spike \u2014 in the shape of himself \u2014 and blames him for the situation he's in. The First then morphs into Buffy and continues taunting Spike as the wheel is raised up to the ceiling, turning him face-first over the symbol on the ground. As Spike's blood falls onto the symbol beneath him, the seal begins to open, allowing \"a real vampire\" to emerge."

Once Buffy disposes of the Bringers, Buffy welcomes the frightened woman, Rona, to Sunnydale. At the Summers house, Willow struggles to sleep on the floor of her room while Kennedy talks constantly from her spot on the bed. Kennedy talks about the luxurious life she had when she was younger, prompts Willow to do some magic and repeatedly attempts to get Willow to join her on the bed, making Willow uncomfortable.",

Xander suggests they be quiet and sleep, but a still-bound and very bored Andrew suggests they speak louder. Buffy arrives with Rona and the gang is updated on the recent activities and findings. The gang lacks answers to most of their current problems like destroying the Turok-Han and rescuing Spike from the First Evil.",

Down in the cave where he's kept prisoner, Spike is approached by one of the Bringers, but for once, he fights back and breaks free of the bonds that hold him to a wall. He runs through the underground tunnels and finds Buffy waiting for him, but quickly is pulled away from his dream and into reality where the First Evil, looking like Buffy, is waiting for him. The First continues to taunt Spike, insisting that Buffy is not coming to save him, but Spike refuses to listen, quietly muttering to himself that Buffy will save him.",

The girl asks about liking a boy who picks on her and seeks Buffy's advice, but Buffy gets a bit distracted with her own similar situation with Spike and rambles about how she's not going to let that problem happen again. Buffy returns home to bickering among the Potentials and news from Willow that another Potential has been found, already in Sunnydale. The Potentials examine weapons and Dawn tries to fit into the group's conversation, but it's a struggle. Spike arrives and then leaves with Buffy and the other girls for some training. Andrew pouts because he's not invited and although silent, Dawn feels left out as well.",

The spell is performed at the fireplace, but at first it doesn't succeed, just creates a horrible smell. Dawn tries to open a door to air out the room, but the light follows her, knocking her into the door and surrounding her. Dawn starts to freak out at the news that she's the latest Potential. She's worried that her becoming a Slayer would mean her sister would have to die first. Dawn doesn't want to tell Buffy what's going on and goes upstairs to think alone while the rest of the gang debate the pros and cons of the situation and telling Buffy. Dawn overhears the conversation and feeling the weight of their concerns and her potential fate of death, she sneaks out the window.",

The girl explains that she managed to get away and lock the vampire in one of the classrooms. Having heard rumors about Buffy, Amanda was going to ask for her help, but Dawn volunteers to take care of the problem. They break back into the school, but when they reach the classroom, they find the door unlocked and don't see the vampire hiding wedged against the ceiling. The vampire falls as the girls try to leave and it chases them out into the halls until they reach locked doors. Trapped, Dawn turns to a fire extinguisher and when she can't get it to work, she knocks the vampire around with it instead then bolts with Amanda.",

While investigating the area, the girls find a dead body, but Buffy shows them that it's a vampire. At the school, Dawn and Amanda hide in a classroom and push a set of drawers against the door while Dawn tries to come up with an escape plan. Buffy tosses the vampire around while lecturing the girls about successful fighting and keeping a straight head during battle. Meanwhile, Dawn puts Buffy's lessons to use and acts resourcefully until the vampire pins her to the ground and goes in for the bite. The Bringers then suddenly break in through the windows and grab Amanda instead of Dawn. After beating up the vampire a bit, Buffy drops her stake on the floor and, along with Spike, leaves the girls trapped alone with the vampire.

However, Dawn compliments Andrew on his bravery in standing up to it. When Spike asks why the First didn't just go to him since he has a trigger, Andrew replies that the First stated it wasn't time for Spike. As they joke about Xander once again being attracted by a demon, Giles interrupts and declares it's time for the gang to stop messing around doing things like going on dates. He adds that they need to get rid of the gun and figure out a plan of action.",

He is well aware that it's the First and intends to ignore it, until the First offers to reveal the identity of mother's killer. Wood shows interest, so it tells him that Nikki was killed by Spike. Wood thanks the First."

As Giles leaves, the First in the form of Richard Wilkins appears to Faith. She knows what he is and isn't fazed, but he prods anyway, praising her for kicking Buffy out and warning that Buffy is a dangerous threat.",
                "Meanwhile Spike works to convince Buffy that she is still needed. She talks about how she detached herself from the Potentials and how detaching herself from people is something she's done for as long as she's been the Slayer. Spike talks about how much he admires her but that this wasn't about his feelings. He says that he knows every side of her and in all the years of his unlife she's the only thing that he was always sure of, but she answers she doesn't want to be the one. Spike starts to leave so Buffy can rest, but she asks him to stay and just hold her.",
                "Robin interrupts Faith and they talk about the First's visits with both of them and the effect it had. They express their apprehension about the coming battle, then Faith takes things in a different direction. They kiss and tumble onto the bed.",
                "Willow returns to her room to find Kennedy waiting for her and all of the other Potentials gone from the room. They kiss, but Willow breaks it up, worried that if they let things go too far, she will lose the self-control that she has been working for and something bad may happen. Kennedy convinces her that everything will be okay and she will \"anchor\" Willow, then the two get back to kissing. Buffy and Spike continue to hold each other, while Anya and Xander, Faith and Robin, and Willow and Kennedy all have sex. The First talks to Caleb about the gang and the knowledge that they are all taking comfort in each others' arms. The priest answers with how he has its strength inside of him and the First's need to feel. The next morning, Faith gives out her orders to the gang, sending some to go find Buffy and others to help her investigate the sewers. Spike wakes up to find Buffy gone and a note left in her absence.",
                "At the vineyard, the First talks with Caleb about their progress, but the First is impatient, worried that Buffy may get her hands on what they have. A Bringer is tossed down the stairs of the cellar and the real Buffy stands at the top, asking for whatever it is Caleb has of hers. Buffy goads Caleb into attacking her, but instead of taking a beating, she keeps her distance and avoids his blows. In the sewers, Faith and the girls find the Bringers' lair and the Bringers that live there. Meanwhile, as the battle with Caleb dies down, Buffy spots a trap door in the floor and dives through it. The girls battle with the Bringers, eventually disposing of all of them. After the fight ends, Kennedy finds a stairway that leads to an area below the sewers. Buffy finds a weapon embedded in a rock, while Faith finds a locked metal box. Faith breaks open the box only to find a bomb inside, ticking away with a few seconds to go as she tells everyone to take cover."

Angel therefore gives her the information he obtained as well an amulet intended to be worn by someone ensouled, yet more than human. He tells her he will fight alongside her, but she turns him down, and he asks for a reason why. She tells him that if she fails to stop the First, she's going to need him to organize a second front. Angel suggests that she actually wants him to leave because of Spike. The two discuss Spike's soul, and Buffy's feelings for him. He shows annoyance about the fact that Buffy has feelings for Spike, claiming that he had a soul before it was cool. Buffy, annoyed by his jealousy, questions his maturity. She denies that Spike is her boyfriend, but confesses that she does have deep feelings for him. When Angel warns her that the relationship would never work, Buffy brings up their own tortured romance. Angel asks about the future and if he has a place in it, and Buffy uses a cookie-baking analogy to explain that she still doesn't know who she is or the person she's going to become and needs more time to find out. Angel agrees to leave and turns over the amulet to her, telling her he'll organize the second front and asks her to make sure he doesn't need it.

Buffy arrives and sees this, causing her to be irritated, stating they someday she should put them in a room and let them fight out their problems and that she has \"had enough jealous vampire crap for one night.\" He asks for the amulet, whose exchange he had witnessed from the shadows, and she explains that it is very powerful and meant only for a champion. She then hands it to him. Buffy tells Spike coyly that Faith still sleeps in her bedroom and she has nowhere to sleep.

Once it does, and the forces of evil outnumber the good the scales will tip in the First's favor and it will become corporeal. The First then shifts into Buffy's form and taunts her, reminding her that she's the slayer, and she's alone as there is only ever one Slayer in the whole.

Willow is concerned since she'll be required to perform the spell required, having never done anything so powerful before. Buffy tells the plan to the Potential Slayers. Afterward, Willow expresses her concerns about using magic again to Kennedy. She says this is the most powerful magic she will have attempted and asks Kennedy to kill her if it turns bad. Faith and Robin also have a discussion while preparing the school for the battle.

Principal Wood leaves to wait at his post for Giles.

She meets the Potentials, Faith, and Spike, and the Potentials and Slayers cut their hands to open the seal with their blood.

Buffy's final speech to the Potentials had revealed that Willow is channeling the essence of the m\u0294 in order to activate Potentials all over the world. Defying the tradition of only one Slayer per generation, Willow's spell will raise an army strong enough to do battle with The First. As Willow performs the actual magic, Kennedy tells Willow that she is a goddess. \"And you're a Slayer,\" Willow replies. Willow then lies on the floor, exhausted and exclaiming \"That was nifty!\", as Kennedy takes the Scythe to Buffy, who is deep in the fight with Faith and Spike against the army of the Turok-Han, now numbering in the thousands.",

She passes the Scythe to Faith and asks her to hold the line. As she lies on the ground, she sees several newly activated Slayers fall, including Amanda. In the halls of the school, a few Turok-Han make it to the surface and attack the group guarding the entrances. A small group of Bringers also appear and attack. During the battle, Anya is cut down by a Bringer.",

You came pretty close to smacking me down,\" before asking Buffy \"What more do you want?\" Ordering the First to \"get out of my face,\" Buffy arises with renewed determination and knocks several Turok-Han off the ledge.
