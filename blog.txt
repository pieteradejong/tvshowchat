Redis blog post:

	
- give schema example of RedisJSON

Steps:
- choose model
- create embeddings for data
- store embeddings in db
- create index in db

# Intro and motivation

# End result, try it here:

# Technologies

# Steps and challenges

* Using the latest RediSearch, and RedisJSON, which docs are new
Prereqs:
Redis 6.x or later
Redis Search 2.2 or later
Redis JSON 2.0 or later

* Index not being created, with 7 failures. `hash_indexing_failures`
"which accoridng to redis docs (https://redis.io/commands/ft.info/), indicate a 'number of failures due to operations not compatible with index schema'. So the schema was the issue, as could be expected with a data-centric operation."

# Conclusion: takeaways and learning

* Since this is new , and I have experience, I might ask redis team if they're open to Python docs and examples to contribute.




Python: how to set and get json paths, and how it maps to dict objects and redis key

Redis JSON and Vector search relatively new and changing, so it's hard to find proper docs, examples, solved issues.
(example of very sparse info:

)



helpful references:

(because actual python code, well organized)


bug?:
docs for:
client.ft.create_index(),
they say:
"**fields**: a list of TextField or NumericField objects"
should include TagField and or VectorField as well?
