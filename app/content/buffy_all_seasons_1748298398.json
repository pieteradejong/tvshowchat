                "A boy breaks a window at Sunnydale High School at night and crawls in, followed by a seemingly reluctant girl. The girl hears an unidentified sound and fears something is there. The boy calls out but gets no response. When the girl is satisfied they are alone, her face morphs into that of a vampire, and she bites the boy.",
                "Buffy has a nightmare on the morning of her first day of school. Her mother drives her to school and encourages her to think positively. In his office, Principal Flutie tells Buffy she will start with a clean slate. He reconsiders that after realizing that Buffy burned down her previous schools gym because it was full of vampi asbestos.",
                "Buffy exits the office and bumps into another student, spilling the contents of her purse onto the floor. Xander comes over and helps Buffy, introducing himself. She leaves without her stake, which Xander attempts to give her back, but she has already walked away. In history class, Cordelia shares her textbook with Buffy. Afterward, Cordelia asks questions to test her coolness factor, allowing Buffy to skip the written because she is from Los Angeles. Soon, Buffy watches in discomfort as Cordelia humiliates a shy Willow at the water fountain. Buffy goes to the library to look for a history book, where Mr. Giles instead places a book titled Vampyr in front of her after realizing who she is. A stunned Buffy makes a hasty exit.",
                "In the school quad, Buffy asks for Willows help studying. Jesse and Xander join their conversation, and Xander returns her stake. Buffy claims its a standard self-defense weapon in Los Angeles. Cordelia appears and tells Buffy she wont get to meet Coach Foster because gym class was canceled due to the extreme dead guy in Auras locker. Buffy asks whether there were marks on the body, and Cordelia says she didnt ask for the morbid details. Alone, Buffy forces her way into the locker room, examines the body, and finds the characteristic puncture wounds of a vampire on his neck.",
                "Buffy returns to the library and confronts Giles, who informs her that he is her new Watcher. Buffy refuses to accept her calling as a Slayer since it got her expelled from her previous school and ruined her social life. After they leave the library, Xander emerges from behind the shelves, confused after having overheard their conversation.",
                "That night, as she walks to the Bronze, Buffy is followed by a stranger. She knocks him down, but the mysterious man assures her he doesnt bite. He warns that she is living on a Hellmouth, which is about to open, and that the Harvest is coming. Before leaving, he claims he is a friend and throws her a box containing a silver cross necklace.",
                "In the Bronze, Buffy meets Willow and encourages her to seize the moment since life is short. She finds Giles and tells him about the handsome stranger and his warning. Giles urges her to learn to hone her skills to sense vampires anywhere. Buffy uses her fashion sense to pick out a vampire in the club and is alarmed to see Willow leave with him. She loses sight of them and is surprised by Cordelia, nearly staking her. Cordelia immediately calls her friends to tell them about it. While Buffy looks for Willow, Jesse chats up Darla, the vampire who killed the boy the previous night. Buffy is stopped by Xander, who doesnt believe in vampires and makes fun of her, but she urges him to help her search for Willow.",
                "Meanwhile, under the streets of Sunnydale, the Master is woken by lesser vampires from a long sleep to prepare for the Harvest. He sends Luke to fetch him young blood.",
                "Willows new acquaintance takes her to a cemetery and forces her into a crypt. They are soon joined by Darla and a weakened Jesse, whom she has bitten. Buffy and Xander arrive, and Buffy slays the vampire who has taken Willow. As Darla and Buffy begin to fight, Xander helps Jesse and Willow escape the crypt. Luke arrives and throws Buffy into a wall. A fight ensues, and Darla flees the crypt. Luke throws Buffy into a stone coffin and moves in to bite her."

Xander is hurt when Buffy declines his help but follows her anyway.",
                "Willow is researching the Master in the computer lab when she overhears Cordelia and Harmony trash-talking Buffy. When Willow attempts to defend Buffy, Cordelia insults her. In turn, Willow suggests Cordelia press the DEL key to deliver her assignment, which erases all her hard work.",
                "Buffy skips school to search for the hidden tunnels in the cemetery. Inside the mausoleum, the mysterious stranger appears just as Buffy is about to enter the tunnel system. He tells her his name is Angel and gives her directions to the Masters lair, only wishing her luck after she is out of earshot.",
                "Xander catches up with Buffy, wanting to help save his friend. They enter the tunnels and manage to find Jesse. They are suddenly ambushed by vampires, and Jesse, upon leading them to a dead end, reveals he has been turned. Buffy and Xander barely manage to escape through a vent leading to above ground, with Xander pulling Buffy out of a manhole. Underground, the Master is unhappy about their escape and punishes the vampire Colin by poking his eye out.",
                "Luke drinks the Masters blood and has a symbol drawn on his brow, turning Luke into the Vessel. Every soul Luke takes will give the Master more strength to break out of his imprisonment.",
                "Buffy and Xander return to the school library. Giles explains that the Master arrived 60 years ago to open the Hellmouth, a portal to another reality, but was swallowed by an earthquake. He is now hoping to escape with the help of a Vessel in a once-in-a-century opportunity called the Harvest. To prevent the Master from escaping and opening the Hellmouth, they must kill the Vessel. Xander suggests that the vampires will be at the Bronze.",
                "On her way there, Buffy stops by her house to get weapons and is promptly grounded by her mother, who has been called by Principal Flutie about Buffy skipping classes. Buffy grabs her weapons from a secret compartment in a chest and climbs out of her bedroom window. Giles, Xander, and Willow head to the Bronze to back her up, with Giles warning Xander that the Jesse they know is dead and all they will see of him now is the thing that killed him.",
                "Luke and other vampires burst into the Bronze and start killing those inside. Buffy arrives in time to save Cordelia before Luke can bite her. She also notices the Vessel mark on Lukes forehead. Xander eventually kills Jesse after a fleeing woman unknowingly pushes him into Xanders stake. Willow pours holy water on Darla when she is about to bite Giles, causing her to run away in pain.",
                "After shattering a window, Buffy tricks Luke into believing a streetlight is the sunlight, then stakes him in the back when he realizes its still night. With Luke dead, the Masters plan fails, and he is weakened again. The other vampires flee. Outside the Bronze, Angel realizes that Buffy has stopped the Harvest, saying, Ill be damned.",
                "The next morning, Cordelia exemplifies the denial most Sunnydale residents undergo after paranormal encounters as she tells a fellow student about the previous night. Giles warns the budding gang of more battles ahead. Buffy, Willow, and Xander walk off while discussing ways that Buffy could get herself kicked out of school. Giles looks on after them and says to himself, The Earth is doomed."

                "Despite Giless misgivings, Buffy decides to try out for the Sunnydale High cheerleading squad to reclaim some of the happy, normal social life she enjoyed back in Los Angeles. Right before the tryouts begin, Xander gives Buffy a bracelet with Yours Always engraved on it. During her routine, the hands of a girl named Amber spontaneously combust. In the library, the gang discusses what happened and the possibilities. Xander and Willow offer to help Buffy by researching Ambers past.",
                "That evening, Buffy returns home and tries to connect with her mom. However, Joyce is distracted by work and setting up the gallerys first major show. They talk about cheerleading, and Joyce inadvertently goes on a guilt trip about Buffys past.",
                "Cheerleading tryouts continue the next day with group work. During the routine, Amy falls and knocks over Cordelia. Afterward, Buffy meets her outside the gym in front of the trophy case. They discuss Amys mom, Catherine the Great. Amy shows admiration for her mothers accomplishments and scorn for her absent father. She is also stressed over not comparing to her mothers cheerleading skills and runs off. Willow shows up and tells Buffy about Amy and their friendship during junior high. Willow reveals that Catherine was emotionally abusive toward Amy. Willow says Catherine would often bully Amy over her weight and at times withhold food.

                "One evening in the Bronze, Xander saves Buffy from a menacing vampire. He then goes on stage to play his guitar solo, promising to later kiss her like she has never been kissed before. In science class, he is awakened from this dream when Buffy points out that he is drooling. The class is taught by Dr. Gregory, who calls on an unprepared Buffy to answer a question about insects. After class, Dr. Gregory encourages Buffy, telling her that she can excel in class if she makes an effort. Once alone, he is attacked by an unseen monster.",
                "That night at the Bronze, fellow student Blayne taunts Xander about his lack of sexual prowess. When Buffy and Willow arrive, Xander puts his arms around both girls to buff up his reputation. Buffy rushes over to Angel when she sees him standing in the corner. Angel gives her his leather jacket when he notices that she is cold. When Buffy sees several slashes on his arm, she jokes that someone must have attacked him with a big fork. He warns Buffy not to let the new threat corner her, as hell rip her throat out. He quickly leaves after the warning.",
                "The next day, Buffy informs Giles that Angel warned her about a fork guy. The substitute biology teacher, Natalie French, shows up and turns every boys head. She seems to be fascinated by insects, especially the praying mantis. French suggests making model egg sacs for the upcoming science fair and asks the class for help. At lunch, Cordelia finds the headless body of Dr. Gregory in the cafeteria locker. In the library, Giles consoles a tearful Buffy. The Scoobies try to figure out if there is a connection to the Master, but they dont rule out the possibility of a second monster.",
                "Later that night, Buffy goes to Weatherly Park, where a homeless person was shredded the night before, and a vampire with a large claw in place of his right hand attacks her. The fight is interrupted by the police, and the Claw vampire flees. While in pursuit, Buffy sees the vampire come up behind Ms. French, who turns to stare at him. To Buffys surprise, the vampire bolts in panic.",
                "At school the next day, Buffy is sent to a counselor to help her get over seeing Dr. Gregorys dead body. This makes her late for the pop quiz that Ms. French gives the class  a test where she tells Xander the answer to a question. Buffy looks in through the door window and sees Ms. French turning her head 180 degrees to look at her. After class, Ms. French asks Xander to come to her house that evening to work on a project. After he leaves, she eats a sandwich made of live crickets.",
                "Back in the library, Buffy convinces Giles and Willow that Ms. French must be a praying mantis. They discover that Blayne, who worked on a project with Ms. French the day before, never came home that night. Buffy tries to warn Xander, but he brushes her off, saying she is jealous. Before he walks off, he expresses his dislike for the name Angel.",
                "When Xander arrives at Ms. Frenchs house, she greets him in a revealing dress and offers him a martini. The drink knocks him out as she transforms into a giant insect. Xander wakes up in a cage next to Blayne, who tells him how she mates like a praying mantis, biting off mens heads in the process.",
                "In the library, the gang discovers that Ms. French is a She-Mantis who lures virgins for her mating ritual. Willow reveals Xander is a virgin, then calls his mother and learns that he never came home. They realize hes in great danger. Buffy gets Giles to record bat sonar  a sound that damages the insects nervous system  while Ms. French chooses Xander as her next victim.",
                "Buffy, Willow, and Giles arrive at the She-Mantis registered address, where they find an old woman who is actually named Ms. French and has been retired from teaching since 1972. To quickly find Xander, Buffy tracks down Claw in the sewers, who can sense the She-Mantis. After they identify the right house, Claw attacks Buffy, but she quickly stakes him with a broken fence post. Buffy breaks through the window when the She-Mantis is about to mate with Xander. She slays the insect, using insect repellent and the bat sonar recording to weaken it. Xander then destroys the eggs in the house.",
                "Later at the Bronze, Buffy sits at the bar wearing Angels jacket when he approaches her. She offers to give it back, but he tells her to keep it as it looks better on her. As she watches him walk away, she is clearly smitten.",
                "After science class, Buffy places Dr. Gregorys glasses in his jacket, which is still hanging in the classroom closet, oblivious to the eggs attached to the bottom of a shelf  or the fact that one is hatching."

                "At night in a cemetery, Buffy stakes a vampire and Giles criticizes her technique. He notices a ring on the ground, which leads him to believe that the vampire she just slayed was not a random kill.",
                "In his underground lair, the Master reads a prophecy from the Writings of Aurelius to his minions",
                "At school, Buffy and Giles are in the library researching the engravings on the ring they found in the cemetery. Owen arrives and inquires about a poetry book by Emily Dickinson. He expresses surprise at finding Buffy in the library since he doesnt think she has any interest in books. After Owen leaves, Buffy quickly tells Giles she needs any books he may have of Dickinsons writings.",
                "At lunch, Willow and Buffy excitedly chat about her interaction with Owen. Buffy spots Owen sitting alone and goes over to join him, but Cordelia beats her to it, inviting him to the Bronze. Ignoring Cordelias invitation, he asks Buffy to meet him there instead. However, Giles has found out about the prophecy from the symbol on the ring and is convinced that the Anointed One will rise that night.",
                "Despite Buffys protests regarding her date with Owen, they spend hours sitting in a cemetery waiting for a vampire to rise. They encounter no vampires, and though Giles is certain that his calculations are correct, he decides to end their fruitless stakeout. Buffy rushes to the Bronze, only to see Owen dancing with Cordelia. Crushed, she leaves without trying to talk to him.",
                "Meanwhile, in a van on the way to Sunnydale, a young boy talks to a man. The man suddenly stands up and begins to lecture the other passengers on Gods judgment, quoting prophecies. Suddenly, a vampire walks in front of the van, causing it to crash. Another vampire swarms the wreck, attacking the passengers.",
                "The next morning at Xanders locker, Owen asks Buffy out on another date that evening and gives her his pocket watch so she doesnt miss it again. Buffy jumps at the opportunity while Xander stews in his jealousy.",
                "In her bedroom later that night, Buffy asks Willow and Xander about what she should wear on her date with Owen. Giles shows up unexpectedly, presenting a newspaper article that shows five people died when the van crashed. Among them was suspected murderer Andrew Borba, the man who was quoting prophecies. Buffy insists on going on her date, stating that it is the 90s and she can be a Slayer while still having a social life. Giles relents and decides to check out the funeral home by himself.",
                "While Buffy is dancing with Owen at the Bronze, Cordelia tries to interrupt them on the dance floor. Meanwhile, Giles is followed to the cemetery by vampires and barricades himself inside a room. Xander and Willow find him through a window and run to the Bronze to find Buffy.",
                "Angel arrives at the Bronze and insists Buffy leave because serious things are about to happen that evening.

Buffy, angry that he has killed her date, kills Borba by sliding him into the burning furnace.",
                "At school the next day, Owen is extremely excited about what theyve gone through and wants more. He says this is what he likes about Buffy, and almost being killed made him feel alive. Buffy realizes that there is no way that she can have a relationship with him sooner or later, he will get himself killed. With a heavy heart, she breaks up with him.",
                "Giles comforts Buffy about her sacrifices by telling her what a burden it was for him as a ten-year-old to find out his destiny was to be a Watcher when he would rather have been a fighter pilot or possibly a grocer. Both agree that at least the Master will also be unhappy because the Anointed One was killed.",
                "Underground, the Master welcomes the real Anointed One  the young boy from the van."

                "The students of Sunnydale High are on a field trip at the Sunnydale Zoo. Buffy is confronted by a group of bullies who pick on her because she was expelled from her previous school. The group then targets another student, Lance. When Principal Flutie interrupts, Lance doesnt denounce them, so they decide to include him in their exploration of the off-limits hyena exhibit. Xander and Willow meet Buffy and express their excitement about being at the zoo.",
                "Upon seeing the bullies enter the hyena exhibit with Lance, Buffy tries to intervene. However, Xander offers to do it himself as it is a non-Slayer-related problem. Just as Xander departs, Buffy and Willow realize Xander will need help and try to follow. They are stopped by the zookeeper, Dr. Weirick. He tells them the hyenas are in quarantine since theyve just arrived from Africa. He also tells them that, according to Maasai tribesmen, hyenas would call out peoples names to separate and then devour them.",
                "At the exhibit, the bullies try to throw Lance into the pit, where a vicious hyena with glowing green eyes appears. Xander arrives just in time and saves Lance. Everyone except Lance is standing atop a large symbol painted on the ground. Suddenly, the group turns to him, laughing and Lance flees the exhibit.",
                "The next day at the Bronze, Willow is eagerly waiting for Xander. Buffy acknowledges Willows obvious crush on Xander. In turn, Willow brings up Buffys interest in Angel, noting that she is currently wearing his leather jacket. Buffy admits to finding him attractive but says she couldnt start a relationship with someone whos rarely around and whose main interest is fighting vampires.",
                "Xander arrives and takes some of Buffys food without asking, but the croissant does not satisfy his hunger. He also sniffs and notes that Buffy has bathed, to which she replies she regularly does. They see the bullies from the zoo making fun of a boy behind them, and Xander laughs at their cruel joke.",
                "In the library, Giles trains Buffy in combat and excuses her, as he needs the feelings to return to his arms. Principal Flutie chases a small pig through the school halls until Buffy picks it up. He introduces him as Herbert, the new school mascot for the Sunnydale Razorbacks.",
                "In the quad, Willow tries to tutor Xander in geometry, but he gives up, saying hell never get it and doesnt care. Willow tells him theyll finish it later, but Xander storms off. As Flutie talks to Buffy about the students lacking school spirit, Buffy returns Herbert to his cage. Xander walks past, and Herbert suddenly starts squealing. Buffy watches him walk away, noticing Herberts reaction to Xander.",
                "In gym class, Coach Herrold announces they have to play dodgeball. Buffy and Willow are placed on the same team, while Xander is in the opposition along with the bullies. During the game, Xander and the bullies eliminate everyone, including Willow, whom Xander throws the ball at harshly. Near the end of the game, Buffy is the only one left on her team. Instead of targeting her, Xander and the bullies throw their balls at Lance, who is their teammate. Buffy rushes over and helps him up.",
                "Willow confronts Xander about his recent behavior. Xander says its because hes changed and so have his feelings for Willow. He tells her that he will drop geometry so he wont need her tutoring, therefore no longer having to look at her pasty face. Xander and the bullies behind him laugh as Willow becomes upset and runs off. Buffy approaches Xander and asks if he has something to say to her. Xander only laughs louder before walking away.",
                "Hungry, Xander and his gang take hot dogs from the other students during lunch. Unsatisfied, they enter the faculty room, where Herbert is in his cage. They close the blinds, and Xander announces, Lets do lunch.",
                "Buffy consoles Willow as she cries about what Xander said to her. Buffy believes something is wrong with him, but Willow thinks something is wrong with herself. She points out that Xander is not as rude to Buffy as he is to her. Buffy insists something weird is happening and decides to consult the expert.",
                "Buffy goes to the library to inform Giles about Xanders change in behavior, clothing, and new friend group. However, Giles brushes it off as normal teenage male behavior caused by testosterone, saying he is likely to prey on the weak. This phrase takes Buffy back to her conversation with the zookeeper, and she believes his change is the result of their trip to the zoo. Giles decides to research, and Willow arrives with the news that Herbert has been eaten.",
                "Principal Flutie confronts the four bullies, claiming they were seen outside of Herberts room. He then orders them to his office with a threat of detention. In the library, Giles believes this to be the work of the Primals, a sect that worships animals, believing that they can reach a sacred state by placing the spirits of animals into themselves.",
                "When Buffy goes to the faculty room where Herbert had been, Xander finds her there. Buffy knocks him down, but Xander rolls her over and ends up on top. He remarks about Buffy liking dangerous men like Angel, giving him more motivation to act violently. Buffy tries to tell him that he is possessed, but he ignores her. She pushes him off, but he holds her against a vending machine. Meanwhile, in Fluties office, the other bullies corner the principal and attack him.",
                "Buffy drags an unconscious Xander back to the library and locks him in the book cage. Giles returns from a teachers meeting and tells them Flutie has been eaten alive, but the official theory is that wild dogs got into his office. Buffy and Giles go to the zookeeper to get information on transpossession while leaving Willow to look after Xander. Xander wakes and tries to talk his way out of the cage. As Willow comes closer, he makes a grab at her through the book slot but misses, losing any chance at getting her to trust him again.",
                "The zookeeper tells Giles and Buffy there was something odd about the imported hyenas from day one. He discovered they were a vicious breed worshiped by the Primals. He has knowledge of transpossession, so he tells Buffy to get all the possessed students to the exhibit. They then realize that the remaining pack will seek out Xander, endangering Willow. Indeed, they arrive at the library and call out to Willow before breaking into the windows. They manage to free Xander but are fended off by Buffy. On the street, the pack attacks a family of three, but Buffy arrives and gets their attention, making them chase her back to the zoo.",
                "At the exhibit, Giles meets the zookeeper, who is wearing the tribal garb. He realizes the zookeeper wanted the hyena spirits drawn into him all along, and the possession of the students was just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He then knocks Giles out. Willow arrives, unaware of what Giles has uncovered. She agrees to let the zookeeper tie her up and hold a knife to her throat, claiming it is the predatory act that will trigger the ritual and save the students.",
                "Buffy arrives with the pack on her tail. Over the symbol, the zookeeper chants, and the hyena spirits transfer from the students into him. He then tries to attack Willow, but Xander saves her while the other four students run off. The zookeeper, now possessed, becomes aggressive. Buffy knocks him into the hyena pit, where they devour him.",
                "The next day at school, Xander is shocked when Buffy and Willow tell him he ate a live pig, saying he has no memory of the possession. He asks if he did anything else embarrassing, but Buffy shrugs it off. As Buffy and Willow leave, Giles tells Xander that none of the research he did on animal possession mentioned memory loss. Still in disbelief over his actions, Xander begs him not to tell anyone."

                "The Master is displeased that Buffy has been slaying his vampires, the latest victim being Zackery. Darla offers to kill Buffy, but the Master believes her reasons are too personal. The Master decides to send the Three, a trio of warrior vampires, to eliminate the Slayer.",
                "The Three ambush Buffy on her way home from a pre-fumigation party at the Bronze. Angel shows up at a critical moment but is wounded during the fight. Buffy and Angel run to her house, and she yells at him to get inside. With the Three on the other side of the door, Angel explains that a vampire cant enter someones home unless invited in. Buffy recalls hearing that but tells Angel shes never had to put it to the test before.",
                "In the kitchen, Angel removes his jacket and shirt so Buffy can dress his wound. She notices a tattoo on his back. Buffy thanks Angel for his help and asks how he happened to be so close by. Buffys mother, Joyce, suddenly returns home from work. Buffy hurries to the front door to ensure her safety and that no vampires enter, then tries to coax her upstairs. Angel, now fully dressed, walks into the room. Buffy claims Angel is a college student tutoring her in history. A skeptical Joyce informs Buffy that it is too late for tutoring and goes upstairs.",
                "Buffy pretends to send Angel off but instead sneaks him up to her bedroom. Angel says he doesnt want to get her into any more trouble, but Buffy insists he stays in case the Three are nearby. They discuss her rooms single bed, and Buffy offers it to Angel since he is injured, but he insists on taking the floor. Buffy questions Angels decision to fight vampires despite not being the Chosen One. She wonders what his family thinks of his career choice, but he explains theyre dead. Buffy asks if vampires killed his family, and Angel confirms. She theorizes that hunting vampires is a vengeance gig for him, but Angel changes the subject. They settle down for the night in their respective spots.",
                "The next morning, Buffy tells Xander and Willow about her night with Angel, calling him a perfect gentleman. Xander protests that Angel is trying to seduce Buffy by saving her life and getting stabbed. Giles identifies the armored vampire trio and reassures the Three are no longer a threat because they must offer their lives in penance for failing their mission. Indeed, the Master allows Darla to execute the Three in his underground lair as a lesson on power for Collin, the Anointed One.",
                "Returning to the library later that day, Buffy begins weapons training. She is disappointed when Giles requires her to start with the quarterstaff rather than the cool crossbow, but she easily defeats her Watcher and progresses to crossbow training.",
                "Later that evening, Buffy brings some food to Angel, who has waited out the day in her bedroom. Buffy asks Angel how he passed the time, and he replies that he did a little reading and a lot of thinking. Buffy notices her diary out of the drawer and nervously explains away entries that reveal her crush on A. Angel stops her and explains that Buffys mother moved the diary while straightening up and assures her he didnt read it. He confesses that he shouldnt be around her because all he wants to do is kiss her. As Buffy approaches him, Angel explains he is older than her and should go. They move closer to one another and begin to kiss. Suddenly, Angel pulls back with a snarl. When he turns back to her, his demon face reveals the truth  Angel is a vampire. Buffy screams, and Angel escapes through her window. When Joyce rushes into the bedroom and asks what happened, Buffy tells her she saw a shadow.",
                "Bringing her friends up to speed before school the next morning, Buffy wonders why Angel was good to her despite being a vampire. Giles insists there are no good vampires  they can retain the memories or personality of the person they take over, but they are still demons at the core. Xander encourages Buffy to slay Angel.",
                "Returning to his apartment, Angel becomes aware of an intruder but seems unsurprised to see Darla. She taunts him, saying that despite living above ground and killing vampires, he will never be human. Angel responds that he is not exactly like her either. Darla tells him that he can only suppress his true nature for so long and he should inform Buffy about the curse to see if she will accept him.",
                "Giles and the gang spend time in the library researching Angels past. They discover that, despite his century-long reputation as the sadistic killer Angelus, he has shunned the company of other vampires since coming to America and has apparently stopped hunting humans. Meanwhile, in the Masters lair, Darla insists on being allowed to kill Buffy. The Master agrees upon hearing Darlas plan to use Angel as her weapon.",
                "That evening in the library, Willow is having a hard time tutoring Buffy in history since they are both distracted by gloom over boys Buffy doesnt want to slay Angel, and Willow wants to attract Xander. Lurking upstairs in the shadows, Darla eavesdrops on their conversation.",
                "Darla arrives at Buffys house and deceives Joyce into inviting her in by claiming to be a friend of Buffy. Lurking outside, Angel hears Joyces scream and rushes in just as Darla begins to drink from her. Daring him to have a taste, Darla shoves the now unconscious Joyce into Angels arms and escapes out the back door.",
                "Buffy arrives home and finds a vamped-out Angel holding her bleeding mother in his arms. Buffy throws him through a window and calls for an ambulance. At the hospital, the gang tries to help Joyce remember what happened. Joyce recalls inviting Buffys friend inside. Buffy misunderstands, believing she is talking about Angel instead of Darla. Buffy races to the library, takes the crossbow from the weapons locker, and storms out into the night.",
                "In Angels apartment, Darla tells him that Buffy is out hunting him right now and that the Slayer could never look at his true face and kiss him. Meanwhile, Giles talks further with Joyce and learns that it was Darla, not Angel, who bit her. With Xander and Willow in tow, he rushes to find Buffy.",
                "Buffy tracks Angel to the deserted Bronze and engages him in combat. Angel tackles and disarms Buffy, but she retrieves her crossbow and fires at him, the bolt hitting the wall beside his head. Buffy demands an explanation, and Angel tells her the story of the Kalderash girl he once killed, whose family cursed him as retribution. They restored his soul, condemning him to eternal torment and guilt for his past sins. Angel denies that he bit Joyce, though he admits to having the desire to do so as well as wanting to kill Buffy. The Slayer lays aside her crossbow and offers her throat to Angel.",
                "Suddenly, Darla emerges from the shadows, boasting that she is the vampire who sired Angel and the two were together for generations. Darla tells Angel that he couldve ruled with her in the Masters court but instead chose to love someone who hates vampires. When Buffy aims her crossbow, Darla pulls out a pair of handguns and fires. Angel crumples to the floor after being shot. Buffy dives for cover behind the bar and shoots a bolt that misses Darlas heart. Hearing gunfire, Giles, Willow, and Xander rush in and distract Darla, shouting to Buffy that it was Darla who bit Joyce, not Angel.",
                "As Darla shoots at Buffy, Angel approaches from behind and stakes her in the heart. Turning around in shock, Darla says his name before crumbling into dust. Underground, the Anointed One consoles the Master over the loss of Darla at Angels hands. He tells the Master that Darla was weak and promises to deliver the Slayer to him.",
                "During the Post-Fumigation Party at the Bronze, Buffy notices Angel across the crowded room and goes over to greet him. Angel tells her they can never work, and Buffy agrees. Instead of walking away, they kiss. Buffy mentions how painful it is, telling him, Ill see you around. As Angel watches Buffy leave, his chest has a burn in the shape of her cross necklace."

                "Cortona, 1418  In a castle in Italy, Carlo kneels before his master, Moloch. The demon promises Carlo everything if he gives Moloch his love. When Carlo pledges his love, Moloch kills him. In a monastery, several priests form the sacred Circle of Kayless to trap Moloch inside a book. The head priest seals the book in a box, hoping it will never be read, or the demon will return to the world.",
                "In the present day, Buffy opens the box with the book, and Giles tells her to put it in a pile. A group of computer science students are helping Ms. Calendar scan books in the library, and she tries to convince Giles that computers are the new way of life. After the class leaves, Willow stays and scans Molochs book. She saves her work and leaves the library, and soon the text Where am I? appears on the computer screen.",
                "A week later, at school, Willow tells Buffy that she has started an online relationship with a boy named Malcolm. Buffy warns Willow about the dangers of rushing into a relationship with someone she has not seen. Moloch eavesdrops on their conversation through a webcam and messages Fritz to keep watch on Buffy. Ms. Calendar questions Fritz about the unusual amount of time he and Dave have spent on the computer and receives an ambiguous answer.",
                "Xander invites Willow to go to the Bronze, but she declines, wanting to talk to Malcolm. Buffy accuses Xander of being jealous. He denies it, claiming he is just worried about Willow because they have no idea if Malcolm is who he says he is. Elsewhere, Fritz repeats, Im jacked in, as he slices his arm in the form of the letter M.",
                "When Willow is late the next day, Buffy discovers she skipped classes to talk to Malcolm. When Buffy asks Dave for help finding out Malcolms real identity, his angry response causes her to think that he is Malcolm. Buffy asks Giles for help, but he confesses he cant help her since he finds computers intimidating. His only idea is for Buffy to follow Dave. As Buffy follows him to the CRD building, a security camera points at her, and a message appears on Fritzs computer screen Kill her.",
                "Back in the library, Buffy and Giles are surprised Xander knows that CRD is Calax Research and Development, a hi-tech company that shut down. Xander assures them it is suspicious because he would have known if CRD reopened, and they decide to break in. When Ms. Calendar interrupts them, she expresses surprise at how much time they spend in the library. Xander and Buffy make an excuse and quickly leave.",
                "During an online chat with Malcolm, Willow becomes suspicious after she learns that he knows Buffy was kicked out of her old school and logs off the conversation. In the library, Ms. Calendar calls Giles a snob due to his aversion to computers, and they begin to argue. Suddenly, she notices that the pages in Molochs book are blank, prompting Giles to rush inside his office.",
                "Outside of school, Dave tells Buffy that Willow wants to talk to her in the girls locker room in a plot to electrocute Buffy. Dave changes his mind at the last minute and warns Buffy, who uses her Slayer reflexes to evade the shock. When Moloch hears of it, he begins writing Daves suicide note on the computer, and Fritz kills Dave.",
                "In the library, Giles tells Buffy and Xander that Moloch is a powerful demon who wins his victims over with false promises of love, glory, and power. In the Dark Ages, books were often used to imprison demons, but, if the books were read, the demons were set free. They realize Moloch has gotten into the Internet after the scanner read his book, and now he can cause a limitless amount of damage. Buffy tries to delete the Moloch file, but his face appears on the screen and warns her to stay away from Willow. Buffy realizes Malcolm is Moloch.",
                "After Buffy finds Daves body, she tells Giles to ask Ms. Calendar for help, hoping they can find a way to imprison Moloch again with his knowledge of demons and her knowledge of computers. Xander and Buffy leave for Willows house, where Fritz kidnaps Willow.",
                "In the library, Giles is surprised that Ms. Calendar knows about Moloch, and she admits to being a technopagan. Meanwhile, in Willows bedroom, Buffy and Xander find a new email from Moloch and head to the CRD building to search for her. Buffy calls Giles, and they coordinate plans.",
                "Inside CRD, a team of technicians has built Moloch a robot body, and he is happy to see Willow. Moloch kills Fritz as a demonstration of his power. Buffy and Xander break into CRD as Giles and Ms. Calendar prepare the binding spell. The spell casts Moloch out of the Internet and traps him inside his robotic body. As Moloch attacks Buffy, Xander, and Willow, Buffy tricks him into punching a high-voltage power line, causing Moloch to explode.",
                "The next day, Giles returns Ms. Calender an earring he found in the library. He tells her about his fondness for the way books smell, and she surprises him by being flirtatious. Meanwhile, Willow feels miserable that Malcolm turned out to be a demon. Buffy tries to cheer her up by reminding her that the guy she had a crush on turned out to be a vampire, while Xander also had the hots for a giant praying mantis. They reason that the Hellmouth is messing with their love lives and joke about how none of them will ever find true happiness. The threes laughter quickly gives way to worry at the thought."

                "Unseen, someone watches a ballet dancer, Emily, stretching backstage. On the stage, Cordelia sings off-key while auditioning for the Sunnydale Talent Show. Giles interrupts her, eager to put an end to her singing. Buffy, Xander, and Willow tease Giles as he complains that Snyder, the schools new principal, put him in charge of the talent show to have more contact with the students. When Snyder overhears the Scoobies making fun of Giles, he punishes them by forcing them to participate in the talent show, making it clear that hes far different from Mr. Flutie because hes not interested in making friends with his students. The next audition is Morgan and his dummy, Sid, and Buffy confesses to being freaked out by dummies. Morgans act takes a sudden turn for the better when Sid suddenly develops a personality and starts making sarcastic comments about the act.",
                "Alone in the locker room, Emily hears a noise. She screams as a voice declares, I will be flesh.",
                "The talent show rehearsals continue with Marc, an unsuccessful magician. Buffy, Willow, and Xander debate what to do for the talent show and settle on a dramatic scene because it does not require any actual talent. Sid watches and makes offensive comments as Morgan explains the voice is an imitation of his father.",
                "Snyder explains to Giles that he will run a safer, more disciplined school, only to be interrupted by the discovery of Emilys body. Her heart has been cut out with a knife, and the Scoobies debate whether the killer is a demon or human.",
                "The Scoobies split up and begin interviewing students from the talent show to find the killer. All of their interviews point in the direction of Morgan and his dummy. After school, Buffy breaks into Morgans locker and finds Sids case empty. Suddenly, Principal Snyder appears and admonishes her for being in the school after hours. Morgan and Sid are hidden behind a door, watching. In the auditorium, Sid insists that Buffy is the one, citing her strength as evidence. When Morgan tells him that he cant do it, Sid says he will.",
                "When Buffy goes to sleep, Sid waits until the lights are off and sneaks into her bedroom. When she hears his footsteps, she wakes up and sees him sitting on her bed. Buffy screams and Joyce rushes in, but Sid escapes before he is discovered. The next morning, Buffy has a hard time convincing the Scoobies that Sid broke into her room. Giles mentions a group of demons that need human organs to maintain their humanity, or they will revert back to their original form.",
                "After a teacher confiscates Sid for disturbing class, Xander steals him so Buffy can talk to Morgan alone. She searches for Morgan backstage, and Snyder is again displeased with her being where she does not belong. In the library, Willow finds references to another possible explanation  animated dummies might harvest organs to become humans. Suddenly, Xander notices that Sid is missing.",
                "Buffy finds Morgans body, missing his brain, just as a chandelier falls on her. When she tries to stand up, Sid attacks her with a knife. During their fight, they realize they both have the same goal to stop the demon.",
                "In the library, Sid explains he is a demon hunter, cursed to dummy form. To break the curse, he must kill the brotherhood of seven demons who harvest organs to maintain their human form. Hes killed six, and only one remains. Sid reveals that he will die when the curse breaks, something he accepts. Realizing the demon has what it needs, they theorize it will be moving on and will be whoever is missing from the show. Sid suggests Giles form a power circle to find out which student is missing, but everyone is present.",
                "Buffy discovers Morgans brain, and the Scoobies learn that Morgan had brain cancer, which is likely why the brain was discarded. They suspect the demon is still looking for another intelligent human to harvest.",
                "At the talent show, Marc convinces Giles to strap himself into a guillotine, pretending it is a magic prop. Buffy, Xander, and Willow rush to rescue Giles, and with Sids help, they kill Marc  who was the demon all along. Sid drives a knife through Marcs heart and collapses as his soul is freed. Buffy takes his dummy body into her arms just as the curtain opens. Confused, the audience assumes it is part of the show.",
                "Later that evening, Buffy, Xander, and Willow perform a scene from Oedipus Rex with a remarkable lack of talent. After Xander forgets his line, Willow runs off the stage."

                "Buffy has a nightmare about being choked by the Master in his underground lair. When her mother shakes her awake, Buffy expresses excitement about spending the upcoming weekend with her father.",
                "At school, Buffy confides to Willow that she suspects she might have something to do with her parents divorce. During class, a teacher asks Wendell to read from the textbook. Tarantulas crawl out when he opens it, causing panic around the classroom. Buffy notices Billy standing in the doorway, saying he is sorry. Underground, the Master tells Collin that fear is wonderful. Although it is the most powerful force in the world, it can be controlled.",
                "The next morning, Buffy is nervous about her father picking her up after school, but Joyce reassures her. The Scoobies head to the library to ask Giles about the spiders. Giles appears confused as he rushes out of the back room and tells them he got lost in the stacks of books. He has no information and suggests they talk to Wendell.",
                "Wendell admits he loves spiders, but they hate him. After Wendells brother killed his pet spiders while he was away at camp, hes been having recurring nightmares about them crawling out of his textbook during class. However, this was the first time it actually happened.",
                "Meanwhile, Cordelia mentions a history test that Buffy has not studied for. Buffy has trouble finding the classroom and doesnt know any of the answers to the test. It appears that time moves rapidly, and she hasnt even finished writing her name when the bell rings. Once again, she sees Billy outside the classroom. Billy watches Laura sneak down to the basement for a smoke break, where she is assaulted by an ugly man saying, Lucky nineteen.",
                "Buffy and Giles interview Laura in the Bowers hospital and are surprised when the doctor informs them about Billy, who has been in a coma as a result of a similar attack.",
                "Back at school, Xander discovers he is only wearing his underwear in front of the class and runs out. As Buffy goes into the library to consult with Giles, he says he has forgotten how to read. However, he has found a newspaper with a photo of Billy. The article says Billy has been in a coma for a week, which contradicts Buffy having seen him. Giles theorizes she might have been seeing Billys astral projection.",
                "Buffys father arrives and asks to talk to her. Outside school, he tells Buffy she is at fault for her parents divorce because she is such a difficult child and he cant stand being around her. He scolds Buffy when she begins to cry and tells her that he never wants to see her again. When her father gets up to leave, Buffy notices Billy watching her.",
                "Xander and Willow meet in the library and quickly realize their worst nightmares are becoming reality. Giles suspects Billy has crossed over from the nightmare world he was trapped in, bringing it along with him.",
                "In the gym, Billy tells Buffy that something bad happened to him after his baseball game, but he doesnt remember. Suddenly, the ugly man appears and attacks Buffy. As they run away, Billy explains he was responsible for his baseball team losing and that it is bad to lose at games. Suddenly, Buffy and Billy find themselves at the cemetery at night.",
                "Meanwhile, the living nightmares continue around school. Cordelia, now with frizzy hair and nerdy clothes, is dragged away and forced to join the chess club. Xander walks down a hallway lined with chocolate bars, eating happily until he is attacked by a knife-wielding clown from his sixth birthday party. Willow finds herself starring in the Madame Butterfly opera and panics because she doesnt know her lines. Overcome by stage fright, she runs away.",
                "Back in the cemetery, Buffy and Billy examine a freshly dug grave. Suddenly, the Master appears and comments that Buffy is prettier than the previous Slayer. Buffy tries to convince herself that she is dreaming, but the Master throws her into a coffin and buries her alive.",
                "Still chased by the clown, Xander teams up with Willow and Giles. He decides to confront the clown and punches him. When they find Buffys grave, Giles explains that Buffys death is his nightmare. Buffy then crawls out of the grave as a vampire. The Scoobies decide they must wake Billy up from his coma to stop the nightmares.",
                "At the hospital, they find Billys astral body watching over his comatose body. When the ugly man arrives, Buffy confronts him. After knocking him unconscious, she encourages Billy to face him. Billy wakes up, and everything returns to normal. Billys Kiddie League coach shows up and refers to Billy as his lucky nineteen. Buffy realizes he must be the ugly man who put Billy into a coma after they lost the game. Buffy confronts the coach, and he tries to run but is stopped by Giles and Xander and eventually arrested.",
                "When Buffys father comes to pick her up for their weekend together, Willow asks Xander if he was still attracted to Buffy as a vampire. He initially denies it before admitting, Im sick. I need help. Willow agrees."

                "At Sunnydale High School, Cordelia is talking excitedly with Harmony and her boyfriend Mitch about spring fashion and the May Queen competition. Suddenly, Buffy bumps into them, spilling various Slayer paraphernalia out of her bag. When she makes up an excuse about borrowing them from Giles for a history project, they laugh at her for spending so much time in the creepy library.",
                "In English class, Cordelia comments that in The Merchant of Venice, the character Shylock is self-involved and whiny. She compares it to running over a girl riding a bicycle the girl whined about her pain and ignored Cordelias traumatic experience. The teacher, Ms. Miller, seems agreeable to her viewpoint. After class, Cordelia arranges to meet with Ms. Miller the next day to discuss her paper.",
                "In the boys locker room, Mitch is attacked by a floating baseball bat. When Xander and Willow mock Cordelia as she campaigns for May Queen, Buffy admits she was the May Queen at her old school. The conversation is interrupted when they hear Mitch was found beaten. Principal Snyder arrives, and Mitch explains what happened as he is taken to the hospital. Willow and Xander distract Principal Snyder, allowing Buffy to slip into the boys locker room, where she finds the word LOOK spray-painted on the lockers.",
                "During lunch, the Scoobies suspect a ghost, and Giles asks Xander to help him research. Meanwhile, Cordelia tells Harmony that Mitch is better but too bruised for prom pictures. In a flashback, Cordelia and Harmony are talking about Mitchs recent breakup with Wendy and whether Cordelia should consider dating him. In the present, Harmony is suddenly pushed down the stairs by an invisible force and injures her ankle. Buffy follows the sound of laughter into the band room, where she feels someone bump into her but finds nothing.",
                "When Buffy tells the Scoobies about being touched by the ghost, Xander suggests a cloak of invisibility worn by the Greek gods. Buffy dismisses that theory due to the pettiness of the crimes. While searching the school after hours, Buffy follows the sound of a flute. In the library, Giles is surprised by Angel, who offers to bring him an ancient book of prophecies, the Pergamum Codex.",
                "In another flashback, Cordelia and Harmony talk in the bathroom while ignoring Marcie. In the present, Cordelia wins the May Queen award. Looking over Willows list of missing students, Buffy suspects Marcie when she sees she played the flute.",
                "After Buffy finds Marcies hideout above the band room, Marcie goes to Ms. Millers classroom and suffocates her with a plastic bag. Arriving shortly after, Cordelia saves Ms. Miller. Behind them, an invisible hand writes LISTEN on the blackboard.",
                "In the library, the Scoobies look over Marcies yearbook and notice it is full of generic Have a nice summer! messages  something you write down in the yearbook of someone you dont know. Willow and Xander are surprised to learn they had several classes with Marcie the previous year but never noticed her. Giles realizes Marcie became invisible because people treated her as if she didnt exist a result of physics, not magic. In a flashback, Marcie is being ignored by Ms. Miller in favor of those around her even when she has her hand up. She puts it down in defeat and slowly starts to fade away.",
                "Cordelia runs into the library and begs Buffy for protection just as they discover she is Marcies intended target. They decide to use Cordelia as bait, with Buffy acting as her bodyguard. In the hallway, Cordelia confides to Buffy that she is also lonely, but being popular beats being lonely by yourself.",
                "Marcie lures Willow, Xander, and Giles into the boiler room, where she locks the door and turns on the gas. She then kidnaps Cordelia and knocks out Buffy. At the Bronze, Buffy and Cordelia awaken and discover they are tied to chairs. When Cordelia realizes her face is numb, they see the word LEARN written on a curtain. Marcie explains that Cordelia will be used as a lesson when she surgically disfigures her face. When a flying scalpel cuts Cordelias cheek, Buffy kicks the instrument tray at Marcie and frees herself from the ropes. Buffy uses her Slayer senses to hear Marcie, kicking her into a curtain before knocking her out. Meanwhile in the boiler room, Angel rescues the Scoobies and gives Giles the Codex. Two FBI agents, Doyle and Manetti, arrive and take Marcie away.",
                "The next day, Cordelia comes by to thank the gang for helping her, much to their surprise. However, she mocks them when Mitch arrives, not wanting to risk her popularity. Meanwhile, Marcie is taken to a school full of invisible students, taught by a teacher from the FBI. She sits down in class and opens her textbook. The title reads Assassination and Infiltration, to which Marcie chuckles and says, Cool."

                "Xander is practicing lines on Willow at the Bronze, preparing how to best ask Buffy to an upcoming school dance. Cordelia is in her car making out with Kevin as Buffy slays a vampire nearby. In the library, Giles is reading the Pergamum Codex and comes across a passage concerning Buffy that shocks him. Suddenly, an earthquake is felt around Sunnydale. In his underground lair, the Master revels in it.",
                "The next morning, Buffy meets Giles in the library and notices the damage caused by the earthquake. Buffy explains that vampires are rising in number and getting braver, but Giles seems distracted. After biology class, Xander asks Buffy to the prom. Buffy gently tells him she doesnt return his feelings and only sees him as a friend. Xander takes the rejection badly and walks off to wallow in his misery.",
                "Giles phones Angel and asks to meet with him as Jenny arrives in the library. She has seen signs of the apocalypse and demands to know what is happening. Jenny mentions Brother Luca, a monk in Cortona, is e-mailing her about the Anointed One. Giles asks her to get more information, promising he will explain everything later.",
                "Kevin and Willow agree to help Cordelia set up the sound system for the dance. Willow sees Xander sulking in an empty classroom and offers sympathy. When Xander asks her to the dance, she refuses to be his second choice.",
                "That evening, Buffy sees blood running from the faucet in the girls locker room. She enters the library and overhears Giles telling Angel that she will face the Master and die the following night. Buffy is devastated and rejects Giles and Angels attempts to comfort her. She tells them she has a way around the prophecy  quitting as the Slayer. In tears, Buffy tells Giles she is only sixteen and doesnt want to die. She rips off her cross necklace and walks out.",
                "At home, Buffy tries to convince her mother to go away with her for the weekend. Joyce tells her that the gallery is open on weekends and then surprises her with a new prom dress. After telling her how she met Buffys father, Joyce encourages her to go to the dance.",
                "The next day at school, Cordelia and Willow find members of the audiovisual club slaughtered by vampires in front of a television playing cartoons. Dressed in her prom dress, Buffy shows up at Willows house and comforts her. Stunned, Willow explains she knew the victims and the classroom where they died, but the vampires had fun making it their world.",
                "In the library, Giles has explained to Jenny that Buffy is the Slayer. After Jenny mentions a Bible verse she received from Luca, he realizes the Anointed One is alive and a child. Giles tells her he intends to face the Master so Buffy wont have to. Buffy arrives and stops him, having accepted her destiny. When Giles refuses to let her leave, Buffy knocks him out. Jenny reminds her that she will die if she fights the Master, and Buffy responds that maybe she will take him with her.",
                "Outside of school, Buffy finds the Anointed One asking for help. She tells him she knows who he is and follows the boy to the Masters lair. Willow and Xander arrive at the library and learn Buffy has gone to fight the Master. Xander leaves, only to show up at Angels apartment demanding him to lead the way to the Master. Xander declares his dislike for Angel, but both recognize the others love for Buffy. Meanwhile, Giles sends Jenny and Willow to warn the students at the dance. However, as they leave, they see an army of vampires approaching.",
                "Underground, the Master and Buffy taunt each other. The Master grabs Buffys neck and overpowers her with hypnosis. He reveals it is her blood that will free him. He drinks from Buffy, leaving her to drown in a shallow pool before breaking free of his mystical prison and rising to the surface. Xander and Angel reach Buffy only to find that she is dead. When Angel says he has no breath, Xander performs CPR on Buffy and revives her.",
                "Cordelia rescues Willow and Jenny by crashing her car through the school building. As the vampires rush inside, the girls help Giles barricade the library doors. Suddenly, a giant tentacled demon smashes through the floor, revealing the Hellmouth underneath.",
                "Buffy regains consciousness and knows where to find the Master. She fights him above the library and, after resisting his hypnosis, throws him down into the library, where the Master is impaled on a jutting shard of wood. His body crumbles to dust, leaving only a skeleton, and the Hellmouth closes.",
                "Buffy, Xander, and Angel meet back in the library, and Giles notes he should have known Buffy wouldnt let death stop her. They decide to go to the prom, with Buffy stating, We saved the world. I say we party. When Jenny asks what they should do with the Masters skeleton, Buffy tells her not to worry since he isnt going anywhere. They depart for the Bronze, leaving the skeleton behind."
