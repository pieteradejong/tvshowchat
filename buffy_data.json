            "Buffy moves in Sunnydale with her mother, Joyce, arriving with the hopes of leaving her Slayer duties behind. However, Buffy inevitably came into contact with her Watcher, the librarian Mr. Giles,[2] and two friends who are willing to fight demons alongside her. They soon realize that the town is located on a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions,[3] which attracts supernatural phenomena to the area.[4]\n",
            "With the Scooby Gang formed, they have to deal with problems faced by the student population as a result of the centrality of the Hellmouth. Such issues include: witches and controlling mothers;[5] demon teachers taking advantage of virgin students;[4] ignored students turning invisible;[6] and bullying students becoming possessed.[7] All along with the never-ending supply of vampires.[2]\n",
            "Buffy's inevitable love interest comes in the form of Angel, who frequently turns up with cryptic warnings for her. However, the relationship becomes complicated when the truth about his past is uncovered. Angel is a vampire with a soul that was restored by a Romani tribe many years before.[8]\n",
            "Meanwhile, the overall concern is the Master's attempts to reach the surface and take over Sunnydale. He is an ancient and powerful vampire who was trapped by an earthquake caused by his attempt to open the Hellmouth decades ago. Buffy and her comrades manage to stop each supernatural threat, typically employing a combination of detective work, frequent physical combat, and extensive research of both ancient mystical texts and computer-accessible records.[3]\n",
            "Ultimately, the Master recruits the prophesied Anointed One,[9] who leads Buffy to her death in the Master's underground prison. The vampire uses her blood to escape to Sunnydale High, which is located atop the Hellmouth, but Buffy is quickly revived by Xander, who had tracked her with Angel's help. She manages to throw the Master onto a shard of wood, and the Hellmouth is closed again.[10]\n"
